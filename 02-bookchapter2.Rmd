# Chapter 2 - Theory

"The Culture is Upstream from Politics, and Religion is Upstream from Culture." --- Need Source Quote. 

This chapter develops a comprehensive theory explaining how and why the three central principles of civil-military relations, which were exposited in the previous chapter, constrain the behavior of the civilian and military actors who conduct civil-military relations. The core argument developed in this chapter (and explored and tested throughout the rest of the book), however, is that this ability of the central principles of civil-military relations to effectively constrain behavior is neither a given nor a constant. Instead, we have to look at two other distinct variables that shape how closely military and civilian actors adhere to the central principles of civil-military relations. These variables are political polarization and the prestige of the military. 

This chapter proceeds in four main sections. First, I provide an overview of the theory that guides the rest of the book. In so doing, I place special emphasis on defining key components of the theory and showing how the components of the theory fit together. The second part of this chapter then explains how the independent variables of polarization and military prestige impact the constraining influence of the central principles of civil-military relations. Incorporating Finer's (1962) "motives and opportunities" framework to describe military intervention in politics, the theory offered here suggests that polarization and military prestige combine to form a total of four broad domestic political environments, each of which is likely to produce certain patterns of political behavior committed by civilian and military actors. This section concludes with the presentation of hypotheses to be tested, analyzed, and explored throughout the book. The third section of the chapter examines alternative explanations and addresses endogeneity concerns within the theory. The fourth section summarizes the theory and briefly discusses the logic behind the empirical methodology employed in the empirical chapters that follow. 

## Overview of the Theory

A visual representation of this book's main theory is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:overview). From left to right, the core argument is that the two independent variables of political polarization and military prestige influence an intervening variable, the constraining influence of the central principles of civil-military relations, which in turn impacts the dependent variable, the political behaviors that military and civilian actors engage in that involve the military. Viewing the theory from left to right helps one at least see the claims of the theory up front, and how the different components fit and work together. But in the paragraphs below, I define the components of the theory in reverse order, beginning with the dependent variable.

### The Dependent Variable, Political Behaviors Involving the Military

In the most general form, a political behavior involving the military is any action that invokes or harnesses the military for a political purpose. The theory further allows for the fact that both civilian and military actors can and often do engage in these behaviors, and therefore, both actor types must be examined in order to have a robust idea of these behaviors.  

It is vital to point out three characteristics of the dependent variable up front. The first characteristic of the dependent variable is that it contains a normative aspect. That is, we must attempt to separate political behaviors involving the military that are appropriate versus those that are inappropriate. In this present study, the difference lies in whether such behavior violates one or more of the central principles of civil-military relations described in the previous chapter of this book. Ascertaining whether such a behavior in fact violates one or more of these central principles is not always an easy or straightforward task, though this book attempts to show how specific behaviors can be operationalized to detect potential violations of these principles. A second characteristic of the dependent variable involves its breadth. Both sets of actors, military and civilian, have engaged in various types of political behaviors involving the military throughout US history. The examples discussed and outlined below hope to capture a healthy majority of the types of behaviors that these actors engage in, but they do not claim to be exhaustive. A third characteristic of the dependent variable involves its simultaneity. That is, because civil-military relations are a dynamic interaction between civilian and military actors, these actors simultaneously engage in political behaviors that involve the military. In the paragraphs to follow, potential political behaviors undertaken by military actors are examined first before shifting attention to those that can be committed by civilian actors. 

### Political Behavior by Military Actors

Military actors can engage in a wide array of political behaviors. Brooks (2009) noted that these behaviors include those that are undertaken by military actors that are designed to influence "policy outcomes" or generate "political costs" that a civilian leader must contend with [@brooks_militaries_2009, 213]. Such a definition is consistent with the broad definition above, i.e., any action that invokes or harnesses the military for a political purpose. It would be difficult --- perhaps impossible --- to render an exhaustive list of the political behaviors or actions that military officers have at their disposal to influence policy outcomes and/or generate political costs for civilians. However, we can conceive of the political behaviors that military officers might engage in as a spectrum. At one end of the spectrum are those behaviors that are deliberately conducted to alter policy outcomes, political futures, or both. Such behaviors would include acts of explicit insubordination by the military or explicit military endorsements of partisan platforms and figures, especially during election seasons. At the other end of the spectrum are behaviors that tend to be far more subtle, and perhaps not even visible to observers, such as the military selectively providing advice or partially complying with civilian directives.^[See @brooks_paradoxes_2020 for a recent example of the military providing selective advice, particularly with respect to how senior US military leaders shaped their advice to civilian leaders regarding the surge to Afghanistan in the early stages of the Obama Administration.] 

Somewhere between the ends of this theoretical spectrum, however, fall a host of other political behaviors that may or may not violate the principles of civil-military relations, depending on how such behaviors are committed and the greater context in which these behaviors occur. The behavior of a military actor running for office is one such example that, in my view, may or may not violate the principles of civil-military relations, depending on several factors. Two of these (and there are probably more) include the timing of the candidate's announcement for political office relative to his or her military service, and the degree to which the candidate harnesses his or her record of military service while campaigning for political office. As to the first factor, it would be important to ask whether the military actor declared his or her candidacy for political office after his or her military service was completed, or before. Assuming the military actor did not declare himself or herself for office while serving on active duty, this study's view is that the military actor did not violate the principle of non-partisanship by engaging in such a behavior. 

The second factor --- the degree to which the military actor harnesses his or her own military service while running for office --- is more complicated. Is it wrong for a political candidate who is also a veteran to showcase one's military service in an attempt to garner votes? Unsatisfactory as the answer may be to some, most (including myself) would say that it depends. For example, long-serving Republican Senator Lindsey Graham appeared in his military uniform after retiring as a Colonel in the US Air Force [@troyan_grahams_2015]. Such an example stands in stark contrast, however, to the case of an active duty military officer actively who campaigned for the US House of Representatives in 2021 while wearing a military uniform [@beynon_army_2021]. Such an act clearly violated the principle of non-partisanship.  

Another behavior that may or may not violate the central principles of civil-military relations is that of writing opinion commentary (a behavior that is examined in great detail in Chapter Three). For example, when General Colin Powell wrote a series of op-eds in the early 1990s while serving as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in which he articulated his views regarding the use of force, his behavior generated political costs for the candidate -- and later President -- Bill Clinton [@powell_opinion_1992; @powell_us_1992]. Moreover, engagement in this behavior by a highly respected and prestigious figure likely influenced public opinion and thus constrained the options available to Clinton as a number of crises erupted across the world in the Balkans, Somalia, Haiti, and Rwanda. In my view, Powell's actions in this instance violated the principle of civilian control of the military. Yet not every op-ed penned by a military actor criticizes the commander-in-chief's foreign policy. When retired admirals and generals write op-eds about the importance of remembering our nation's fallen on Memorial Day, for instance, they are not creating political costs for the President to contend with. 

Table \@ref(tab:pol-behav) lists and describes several types of political behaviors that military actors may engage in. Several of these behaviors were first theorized by Risa Brooks (2009), but I have built upon her typology by adding three additional types of behaviors and by placing them in a general order of severity [@brooks_militaries_2009, 219]. That is, near the top of the table are those behaviors that nearly by definition tend to violate the principles of civil-military relations. As discussed in this section, these include the behaviors of explicit acts of insubordination and partisan politicking. The table also includes six other behaviors which, unlike the top two, are those that may or not be inappropriately political, depending on _how_ such behaviors are conducted and the _context_ in which these behaviors occur, as discussed above.^[The act of resignation in protest is one behavior that scholars debate. Many, such as @m_shields_introduction_2017 and @golby_beyond_2015 view the behavior as an overtly political act of defiance. Other scholars see the act of resignation differently, and instead argue that a military officer's moral agency should at least allow for the possibility that in extreme circumstances, resignation is not only appropriate, but a justified and even necessary outcome, particularly in response to an immoral order which violates the officer's moral conscience. For such views, see @dubik_principled_2014; @snider_strategic_2014; and @milburn_breaking_2010.]

In summary, military actors have a wide arsenal of behaviors they can conduct in order to influence policy and political outcomes, raise the political costs borne by civilian leaders, or both. Some types of behaviors, such as acts of explicit insubordination and partisan politicking, fit squarely into this description, and almost always violate one or more of the central principles of civil-military relations. Other types of behaviors, such as making public appeals and running for office, may not always occur out of a deliberate desire to alter policy, influence political futures, or generate political costs. The most well-known collisions that have occurred between the President and various wartime Commanders throughout American history -- Lincoln and McClellan, Truman and MacArthur, Obama and McChrystal -- perhaps threaten civil-military relations in the most recognizable and public ways. Yet there are many other subtle and nuanced means through which military actors may behave in a way that can violate one or more of the central principles of civil-military relations. 

### Political Behavior Undertaken by Civilians

Like military actors, civilians can also engage in behaviors that harness the military _solely_ for a political purpose. A good definition of political behaviors engaged in by civilians that adversely "politicize" the military comes from Jim Golby's (2021) concept of "civilian activation," which he defines as efforts "by civilian political elites to court or co-opt the military for personal, partisan, or electoral gain" [@golby_uncivil-military_2021, 153]. 

Scholars of comparative relations have long noted the behaviors civilian leaders may engage in, particularly for the purposes of consolidating their hold on power. For instance, Quinlivan (1999) articulates a series of "coup proofing" behaviors civilians may undertake in order to prevent military forces from launching a coup, such as establishing "parallel" militaries who hold a "special loyalty" to the regime in power [@quinlivan_coup-proofing_1999]. Similar civilian efforts are described and articulated by De Bruin as "counterbalancing" behaviors [@de_bruin_will_2019]. Though these somewhat drastic types of behaviors are typically thought to occur primarily in autocracies or weak democracies, there are nonetheless a host of political behaviors that civilian leaders of mature democracies can undertake involving the military which seek to further that leader's political and/or partisan advantages.  

However, just as identifying and assessing the political behaviors undertaken by military actors requires awareness of the contextual circumstances in which these behaviors occur, so too does the context surrounding a particular action matter a great deal. In fact, identifying and evaluating political behaviors involving the military by civilians may be an even _more_ difficult exercise than it is for military actors because, as Golby notes, "elected political leaders often provide alternative explanations to legitimize or excuse their behavior," and observers cannot readily or easily observe the "intent" of the civilian actors who engage in such behaviors [@golby_uncivil-military_2021, 152]. 

A somewhat recent, real-world example illustrates this dynamic very well. Consider the case of former President Trump making a surprise visit to Iraq around Christmas in 2018. Presidents have long visited military bases to meet and interact with Troops, make major policy announcements, and in the case of visiting service academies, to preside over officer commissioning ceremonies [@obama_remarks_2011]. During US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Presidents made several surprise visits overseas. President Trump's visit in 2018 generated a moderate level of controversy, however, because as some critics alleged, the President's visit had more the look and feel of a partisan campaign stop than that of a Commander in Chief visiting the Troops. Indeed, some of the Troops reportedly adorned hats and other "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) gear during the President's visit, which the President happily signed [@fritze_trump_2018]. 

In this example, the President's visit to Iraq itself was not problematic. What was problematic, however, was the way in which some Troops appeared to endorse the President in clearly partisan tones. It is unclear whether the President or members of his staff encouraged Troops to wear the gear, or whether the Troops spontaneously adorned the gear on their own. In the case of the former, we could rightly classify the action as a civilian political behavior. In the case of the latter, we would instead lean towards classifying the incident as a political behavior by military actors. In reality, this incident was probably a combination of both. 

If we again conceive of the possible political behaviors that civilian actors can undertake within mature democracies as a spectrum, we can envision one end consisting of behaviors that are unquestionably committed exclusively for partisan or political advantage. These would include acts such as appointing military actors to positions on the basis of shared partisan or ideological alignment, or engaging in a truly diversionary use of force, either at home or abroad.^[The act of civilians appointing officers on the basis of shared partisan convictions is one manifestation of what Huntington called "subjective civilian control." See @huntington_soldier_1957, 80-81 for more details.] Near this end of the spectrum would also include the civilian behavior of featuring military actors to speak at major partisan political conventions or gatherings, or to explicitly endorse or attack political candidates during political campaigns. 

On the other end of this spectrum are behaviors that involve the military for partisan advantage, but in a far more subtle form. Suppose, for instance, that a Presidential candidate seeks to garner support for his or her healthcare plan. The candidate asks an elderly military veteran to travel with him or her in order to publicly affirm the candidate's plan. Perhaps this involves the veteran standing up during town halls, or being asked to briefly affirm during debates that the candidate's healthcare plan indeed takes care of the nation's veterans. Such a behavior attempts to leverage the military for partisan gain, but in a far more subtle way than using a military actor to speak at a political convention. 

Somewhere between the ends of this spectrum lie a number of other behaviors, each depending on the specific details of _how_ the behavior is undertaken. Some examples might include civilian political candidates featuring generic military images and symbols in their campaign ads. Featuring general images of US Troops in uniform while patriotic music plays in the background of an advertisement is likely not a problematic political behavior. However, if an advertisement instead features images which contain the faces of recognizable senior military leaders in uniform, while the narrator also states, "Candidate X is trusted by the military to defend the nation," then that advertisement more directly conveys a partisan connection between the candidate seeking office and the military officers shown in the ad. In the latter instance, assuming the military officers whose faces were featured in the advertisement were not given a chance to refuse appearing in the ad, the civilian actor (either the candidate or the candidate's campaign team) has committed an inappropriate political behavior.^[If the officers did agree to appear in the campaign ad, the behavior would still be inappropriate, but the responsibility would be shared between the civilian candidate and the military actors.]

As the preceding examples have made clear, determining the degree to which the behaviors described in Table \@ref(tab:pol-behav-civ) are problematic can be a difficult endeavor. It is not always clear why a civilian actor behaves in a certain way, making assessment of intent somewhat complicated. Those who observe political behaviors may simply disagree on whether a certain instance is truly inappropriate. For example, while some observers alleged that President George W. Bush's use of General David Petraeus in garnering Congressional support for the "surge" strategy in Iraq in 2007-2008 politicized the military in unhealthy ways, one might disagree on the grounds that Petraeus, having both the knowledge and experience from having served previously in Iraq, was precisely the right individual to speak to Congress about the new strategy [@coll_generals_2008]. 

Another example also illustrates this point. During Donald Trump's tenure in office, the former President deployed several thousand troops to the US border with Mexico in the fall of 2018 in response to an impending caravan of migrants from South America. Some observers saw the move as a type of political move ahead of that year's midterm elections, including several retired Army Colonels who penned an op-ed titled, "Trump's Border Stunt Is a Profound Betrayal of Our Military" [@adams_trumps_2018]. At the same time, others, especially those on the political right, saw the move not as a politically motivated use of the military, but rather as a drastic yet shrewd response to a legitimate crisis that had developed on the US southern border [@wright_trumps_2018]. Aside from the obvious fact that opposing partisans are likely to view the former President's behavior very differently, the fact that troops remain deployed at the border -- under a subsequent Presidential administration of a different political party -- at the very least suggests that the use of Troops for the purposes of assisting border and customs agents is helping to alleviate what is in fact a genuine problem [@beynon_militarys_2021].

In summary, civilian leaders can engage in political behaviors that challenge civil-military relations, much in the way that military actors can. Much like the behaviors that military actors engage in, the political behaviors that civilians undertake vary significantly. Some tend to be obviously committed for partisan reasons, such as a civilian leader assigning military officers on the basis of shared partisan or ideological convictions, or selecting military actors to speak at major political events. Other civilian behaviors involve more subtlety, and thus are not entirely inappropriate, such as visiting military bases, or using military symbols and images to show general support for the Troops. Thus, identifying and evaluating the political behaviors undertaken by civilian actors, much like those engaged in by military actors, requires awareness of the details and context in which these behaviors occur.

### Identifying, Operationalizing, and Evaluating Political Behaviors Involving the Military
\doublespace

Because the intent of an actor is not always visible, and because civilian leaders in particular are prone to offer alternative explanations for behaving in a certain way [@golby_uncivil-military_2021, 152], scholars of civil-military relations need a more consistent and objective way to identify and assess political behaviors involving the military. For this reason, I propose that the three central principles of civil-military relations offer a broad yet valuable baseline with which to identify and evaluate political behaviors that involve the military. In short, scholars should examine a civilian or military actor's behavior and ask whether and to what degree such an action violates the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference of the military.  

Answering these questions requires operationalizing violations to each of the three central principles in a particular way based on a specific type of behavior. Indeed, I take up precisely this task for two specific forms of behaviors in Chapters 3 and 4 of this dissertation -- that of military actors authoring opinion commentary, and civilian actors featuring military leaders in campaign advertisements. While the observer of civil-military relations will still wrestle with determining whether and how much a particular act violates one or more of the central principles of civil-military relations, using the three central principles as a lens through which to identify problematic political behaviors is more advantageous than trying to ascertain the true intent of an actor, wade through a litany of potential alternative explanations for committing an act, or gauge the political cost borne by civilians in response to the behavior of military actors. 

There are at least two major advantages to developing and employing a framework that measures political behavior by adherence to the three central principles of civil-military relations. The first distinct advantage involves the sense of unity surrounding the primacy of these principles. As the last chapter argued, scholars such as Samuel Huntington as well as his critics share the aspirational ideal of military and civilian actors adhering to the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference of the military. 

A second advantage to identifying and measuring political behaviors through the lens of adherence to the central principles of civil-military relations emerges. As I seek to demonstrate later in this dissertation, doing so allows the researcher to examine political behaviors over time. Scholars to date have not examined changes in political behaviors over time in part because an objective, consistent measurement strategy does not exist. I am not arguing here that historical contexts are not important; indeed, they most certainly are. However, scholars of civil-military relations need to better understand what generates variation in political behavior. The framework offered here is one such starting point. 

The rest of this chapter explores why civilian and military actors become more or less committed to upholding the central principles of civil-military relations. I argue that the levels of two domestic variables --- the levels of political polarization and military prestige in a society --- alter the extent to which these actors adhere to the central principles of civil-military relations. Furthermore, I argue that higher levels of polarization and military prestige alter the overall constraining influence of the central principles of civil-military relations such that when one or more of these variables exist at relatively high levels, civilian and/or military actors are willing to behave in ways that violate the principles of civil-military relations. In the next section of the paper, I define each of these independent variables and trace their respective levels in contemporary America.

## IV1 - Political Polarization

The first independent variable of study in this dissertation is political polarization. Polarization is a concept that is difficult to define precisely. In American politics, polarization generally refers to the movement of thoughts and attitudes within a political community away from the political center and toward more ideological extremes [@hare_polarization_2014; @abramowitz_great_2018]. Within international relations, polarization is often defined the same way, but scholars of international relations are interested in different applications of polarization, such as how polarization contributes to a state's ability to recognize common threats, learn and derive lessons from foreign policy failure, and agree on what role a nation should play on the world stage [@schultz_perils_2017; @myrick_external_2021]. From the perspective of political theory, political polarization describes the degree to which a society shares fundamental values, is capable of incorporating divergent worldviews, and the overall degree to which these values unite versus divide a nation [@marsden_twilight_2014; @deneen_why_2018]. In this dissertation, I rely on a conception of polarization both as the divergence of political attitudes away from an ideological center and toward the extreme, as well as a conception of the term that recognizes the difficulties which arise when a society increasingly disagrees about the fundamental values and worldviews that should govern it. 

### Perspectives on Polarization's Causes and It's Implications

Perspectives regarding the _causes_ of political polarization in the United States vary. Scholars have pointed to a variety of causes of polarization, including differences of opinion over issues pertaining to race and religion [@abramowitz_great_2018], the size and role of government [@sides_two_2015], normative conceptions of personal and national identity [@sides_identity_2018], and other specific policy matters [@mann_its_2012]. Other scholars, mainly political theorists and cultural historians, have argued that the current polarized environment in the United States is the result of a slow yet steady political shift that began in the 1950s -- a shift that reflects both the incompatibility of American pluralism to reconcile and "embrace a wide range of both religious and nonreligious viewpoints" [@marsden_twilight_2014, 171] and the inability of liberalism as a political philosophy to deliver on its intended promises of securing individual rights in a manner that is equitable and fair [@deneen_why_2018]. What is common to most explanations of polarization in the United States is the notion that American society is increasingly divided today because of the loss of support for the collective values and purposes that should guide and unite it, and that the various worldviews that seek to influence society today are "utterly distinct in their presuppositions, values, and outcomes" [@allen_why_2020, 128]. 

The worldview from which one operates is important. As Sire has posited, a worldview "is a commitment, a fundamental orientation of the heart...about the basic constitution of reality, and that provides the foundation on which we live and move and have our being" [@sire_universe_2020, 6]. Simply put, one's worldview will influence, at some point, one's behavior.^[Sire further defines one's worldview as how one answers eight fundamental questions, including "what is a human being?", "what is prime reality -- the really real?", and "how do we know what is right and wrong?" See @sire_universe_2020, 8-9 for an introduction to worldview thinking.] Thus, the contestation of worldviews that reflects today's highly polarized climate in the United States well captures the idea and the feeling of American society being pulled in drastically different -- indeed opposing -- directions. 

Scholars note the presence of three characteristics or features that further describe the current polarized political landscape in the US. The first feature of polarization in the contemporary United States is that it goes far beyond political differences between political elites [@mann_its_2012]. In other words, today's polarized landscape extends beyond the halls of Congress in Washington, D.C. While one can argue that ordinary citizens may not feel as strongly as elected politicians about every political issue at stake today, the fact is that the level of disdain held by regular Americans for both political parties, as well as those who identify as being on the opposite side of the political spectrum, has risen sharply over the past several decades. This phenomenon is known in the American politics literature as "affective polarization" [@iyengar_affect_2012; @iyengar_origins_2019] or "negative partisanship" [@abramowitz_great_2018]. 

A second feature of contemporary polarized politics in the United States is the increasing scope and number of issues that have become included as part of the partisan battleground. Politicians and citizens do not disagree and wage political war over a handful of important issues, but rather -- at least seemingly -- over everything! Scholars of American politics describe this dynamic of increasing political warfare as "conflict extension" [@layman_party_2002]. As one might expect, the dynamic of "conflict extension," in which every political issue seems to constitute a hefty partisan political battle, has dampened prospects for meaningful cooperation across partisan aisles and other demonstrations of bipartisanship [@layman_activists_2010]. 

A third and increasingly contentious feature of contemporary political polarization in the United States is that issues of personal and collective identity are progressively associated with partisanship - to the point that partisan identity itself is an important component of how people view themselves and others [@sides_identity_2018; @robinson_michael_danger_2018]. This feature of polarized politics is perhaps most clearly illustrated by the rise and influence of American "identity politics" in which the normative roles of race, gender, religion, and immigration invoke very strong commitments from individuals on both sides of the partisan aisle [@white_values_2002; @mann_its_2012; @sides_identity_2018]. The prominence of these identity-related issues in politics affirms that these concerns are not merely peripheral interests, but rather principles held by citizens who care deeply about and consider them to be of fundamental concern.

In political science, one of the benchmark measurements of polarization in the United States has been that of dynamically-weighted, three-step estimation scores (DW-NOMINATE), which are derived from examining roll call voting patterns among members of Congress [@jeffrey_b_lewis_voteview_2020]. Figure \@ref(fig:polar-chamber) shows polarization levels present in the US House and Senate since the latter portions of the 19th Century [@hare_polarization_2014; @jeffrey_b_lewis_voteview_2020]. As Figure \@ref(fig:polar-chamber) demonstrates, polarization levels in the United States were high around 1880, and remained high before gradually decreasing early in the 20th century. The figure further shows that polarization reached its nadir in the years before World War Two, then remained at relatively low levels until approximately the mid-1970s. Since that time, however, polarization in both chambers of the US Congress has increased dramatically, to the point that contemporary levels now exceed those previously recorded.  

Polarization has been measured in a second way in the American politics literature. First derived by Iyengar et al. (2012), measurements of "affective polarization" or "negative partisanship" have been derived by using data from the American National Elections Studies (ANES) [@iyengar_affect_2012]. Beginning in the late 1970s, the ANES has asked a series of "feeling thermometer" questions, in which respondents are asked to provide, on a scale ranging from 0-100, how they feel about a range of topics, including their feelings about political parties. Figure \@ref(fig:affect-polar) graphs the results of how partisans feel about members of their own party, members who affiliate with the opposite party, the difference between these two answers, and a total level of affective polarization, which is the sum of the difference for each of the two main parties in the United States.

As Figure \@ref(fig:affect-polar) shows, measurements for how favorable each party is have remained more or less constant over the past several decades. However, partisans have increasingly rated those on the opposite side of the political spectrum as increasingly less favorable over the same time period. In other words, data shows that partisans do not necessarily like the party with whom they affiliate more, but rather that they disdain those on the other side of the aisle at greater levels.

### Why Does Polarization Matter?

One does not have to look far today in the American political culture to grasp the fact that current levels of polarization are high. Indeed, it is little wonder that both candidates running for President of the United States in 2020 claimed that the very "soul of the nation" was at stake [@dias_biden_2020]. The questions with which the United States is wrestling about itself reflect not only political differences among America's elected leaders, but significant gaps between the worldviews of the nation's citizens and the fundamental core values that should be adopted, implemented, and practiced. 

A cursory examination of just a handful of these polarizing questions confirms that they are not easy questions, nor likely to be solved without eliciting a strong response from individuals, depending on which worldview(s) one holds, or which political party or political ideology one supports. To be clear, my aim in listing these questions below is two-fold: first, to demonstrate that there are a host of consequential and important questions in the US today with significant political and policy ramifications; and second, to convince the reader that those who hold to a particular set of answers to each of these and other questions likely feels very strongly about what the right and correct answers are to these questions. There are many other questions than those listed here, but these are intended to serve as an example of the many contentious issues that are impacted by the worldview and ideology one holds.      

\singlespace
* What does it mean to be an American? Is there a slate of common "American Values"? What are they?
* Should America be proud of its history, and to what degree? 
* Is the United States an "inherently racist" country? Are our schools and universities "inherently racist"? Why or why not?
* To what degree should the United States be proud of its Constitution, and of those American founders who wrote it?
* To what degree should the United States have and enforce its national borders? 
* Is abortion a human "right"?
* Is the construct of gender important anymore, and to what degree? Are there any meaningful differences between men and women, and if there are, should these differences be acknowledged and celebrated or completely downplayed?  
 
\doublespace
These questions, and many more, illustrate how different worldviews reflect drastically different ideas of how the United States should look moving forward. These questions are qualitatively different from policy questions such as what percentage of national GDP should be spent on the military, whether charter schools should be supported or opposed, and whether the debt ceiling should be raised in times of fiscal crisis and uncertainty. While these types of questions also often lead to significant and intense political divisions, and sometimes to important policy ramifications, they do not reflect the same degree of intensity as those listed above that weigh importantly on an individual's deeply held beliefs, values, and overall worldview [@white_values_2002; @mann_its_2012; @sides_identity_2018]. How the nation handles these questions will likely set a tone that will have lasting impacts on the nation's values, now and into the future. 

In this dissertation, I argue that members of the US military are not immune from holding strong views and opinions on central questions such as those listed above, or on any issues in the political sphere that involve worldview commitments or ramifications. I argue that the views held on these types of central questions and issues by various military actors stem from their personal worldviews, and thus involve the moral values that they hold dear and cherish. Therefore, I argue that when these types of central and consequential issues and concerns are at stake, members of the military will increasingly behave in a way that advances the values and worldview that they believe in, even if doing so runs counter to the foundational principles of civil-military relations: maintaining civilian control, the military's non-partisan ethic, and the military not interfering in certain areas of state policy. 

## IV2 - The Military's Prestige 

The second independent variable examined in this study is the military's level of prestige. In defining prestige, I follow the sociological literature regarding the stratification of professional occupations and professions to denote two related yet distinct components that comprise the variable of prestige [@davis_conceptual_1942; @jaco_prestige_1970]. Both of these components have relevance for the variable of military prestige. 

The first component deals with how important an occupation or profession is in terms of its positional role in society, or what Davis (1942) calls, "the invidious value attached to any given status or office" [@davis_conceptual_1942, 312]. This first component of military prestige has in mind the relative _importance_ or _centrality_ of the military with respect to the function it serves, and the roles or tasks that the military as an institution carries out. We might anticipate that the importance or centrality of the military varies as a result of factors such as the threat environment. For example, a society that lives under the constant threat of attack by another nation, and whose military is constantly working to ensure that these threats are defeated, may view its military as more central to the state than another society that rarely faces significant threats. 

The second component of prestige examines society's evaluation of the _performance_ or _excellence_ of an occupation or profession, or the manner in which its members "[carry] out the requirements of [their] position" [Linton, 1936 as cited in @davis_conceptual_1942, 312]. Applying this to the prestige of the military, this second component of prestige thus deals with the degree to which society deems the military is skilled, or the degree to which the military is meeting society's expectations. We might expect this component of military prestige to vary according to different factors than those that impact the _centrality_ of the military. For example, war outcomes (victory or defeat), or the presence of internal scandals, might impact a societal evaluation of the skill of the military, or the degree to which the military is meeting society's expectations. 

The distinction of these two related yet different components of the variable of military prestige matters insofar as theoretically, these two components may operate at different levels. It is possible, for instance, for a military to be viewed as highly central or important, but nonetheless not very skilled, or for a military to be seen as skilled, but relatively unimportant to a society. The first case study of this dissertation, which examines the military during the late 19th Century, in fact argues that during the late 1870s and early 1880s, society viewed the military as less central to the nation than relative to how it had been viewed 15 years earlier. Even so, society simultaneously venerated the military service of individual military leaders, many of whom were considered heroes of the Civil War. 

Furthermore, it follows that changes to the overall level of military prestige may be driven by one or both components of military prestige. For example, the US military victory during the Gulf War likely did not primarily alter the centrality of the military in terms of the function it fulfilled to the United States. The military had, well before the Gulf War, occupied a central role - defending the nation - throughout the Cold War period. Rather, the victory achieved by US forces in the Gulf War did change how Americans perceived the military's skills and professional excellence. When President George H.W. Bush proclaimed, in 1991, that "It's a proud day for America. And, by God, we've kicked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all," his comments primarily pointed to the fact that the US military had shed any lingering perceptions or doubts regarding its abilities, dating back to the end of the Vietnam War [@bush_george_1991]. Senior military leaders who participated in the Gulf War likewise viewed that victory as the signature expression of an Army that had, in the two decades after Vietnam, rebuilt itself [@kitfield_prodigal_1997]. 

In the following section, I summarize the contemporary US military's high level of prestige through each of the two components described above. I will describe the military's centrality to the nation by briefly tracing how, for a majority of the post-World War Two era, the US military has played a central role in foreign policy. Then, to examine society's perception of the military's professional excellence, I will describe how society's level of public trust in the military has changed over the past several decades. Today, the modern, all-volunteer military is somewhat exclusive and distant from many segments of American society, and fewer Americans can relate to the military writ large. This has rendered the military institution increasingly popular, but also somewhat mysterious.^[It is important to point out that even as I write this dissertation, it is possible that several events that have unfolded over the past few months may in fact reduce the military's level of prestige. For instance, the full impacts of the chaotic withdrawal of the US from Afghanistan in August 2021 on the military's level of prestige may not be tangible or fully show up in American public opinion for some time. There are early signs of strain, however, as 2021 Gallup polling revealed that the percentage of Americans who highly trust the military is roughly on par with percentages that existed prior to September 11, 2001. See @noauthor_confidence_2020 for more details.]    

### The Centrality of the Military Institution

Over the past seventy-five years, the United States has instituted a series of significant bureaucratic reforms that have significantly expanded the military's scope and influence within the government. As a result, the military is, for better or for worse, a massive organization that influences a wide range of foreign policy and national security outcomes. 

This has especially been the case since the end of World War Two. In the aftermath of this victory, which thrust the US onto the international stage, President Truman signed The National Security Act of 1947, which sought to unify the defense and intelligence establishments. Despite achieving victory in World War Two, the military services, and the leaders in charge of them, had squabbled a fair bit throughout the war [@kaiser_no_2014]. The National Security Act created new institutions, including the National Security Council (NSC), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the US Air Force [@noauthor_national_1947], and more formally, merged the Departments of War and Navy into the "National Military Establishment," which was essentially the precursor to what became the Department of Defense in 1949 [@locher_has_2001]. 

These reforms wrought by the National Security Act were not only reflective of the central role that the nation's military would play in international affairs, but they also proved to be quite successful. So influential was the National Security Act that fifty years after its signing, President Bill Clinton stated that as a result of the institutions created by the National Security Act and the people who had served in them, a generation had "helped to secure the peace and prosperity that America enjoys...the success of their efforts and of the historic legislation enacted half a century ago is reflected in an outstanding record of achievement: nuclear war averted, the Cold War won, and the nations of the world turning to democracy and free markets" [@clinton_weekly_1997]. 

A second set of major institutional defense reforms was undertaken in the mid-1980s. Known as the Goldwater-Nichols Act after Senator Barry Goldwater and Congressman William "Bill" Nichols, several incidents that occurred in the early part of that decade exposed deficiencies in aspects of US military operations, including that it lacked the ability to operate in _joint_ environments, or those which required military personnel and equipment from across the individual military services [@kitfield_prodigal_1997].^[This included the the failed Iranian hostage rescue mission in 1980. For an excellent account of how this tragic event spurred the evolution of joint military organizations and doctrine, see @kitfield_prodigal_1997.] The ultimate goal of the Goldwater-Nichols Act was to ensure that in an age in which military technologies and equipment were becoming increasingly sophisticated, American national defense interests would be identified and prioritized over and above the parochial organizational interests of the separate military services [@locher_has_2001]. 

Among the most significant of the changes wrought by the Goldwater-Nichols Act was codification of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as the President's principal military adviser, a change which meant that all advice from the respective individual service chiefs of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps would flow through the new Chairman as the single point of contact [@locher_has_2001; @wills_effect_2016]. Furthermore, the Goldwater-Nichols Act created several regional combatant commanders, each of which would report directly to the Secretary of Defense [@locher_has_2001; @wills_effect_2016]. In essence, the Goldwater-Nichols act institutionalized both the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combatant Commanders as powerful military voices.  

A final source of the contemporary military's importance to the nation can be understood through the widening scope of responsibility it has assumed, especially in the post-9/11 era. Although the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq each involved a sizable civilian component for at least a portion of the war, the military nonetheless assumed control for a significant portion of the day-to-day decision making of these conflicts, even over issues that once were, or ostensibly should be, civilian endeavors.^[To be clear, it is doubtful that the military and other governmental organizations applaud these developments. The topic of the interaction (or lack thereof) of military and civilian efforts during the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts has become a burgeoning literature that includes a mixture of official government reports, autobiographical memoirs, and works that offer other theoretical and historical insights. For a sample of this literature, see @iraq_study_group_us_iraq_2006; @ricks_fiasco_2006; @chandrasekaran_imperial_2007; @hodge_armed_2011; @chandrasekaran_little_2013; @gallagher_day_2019.]

In summary, today's military has become remarkably prestigious in part because of the institutional reforms enacted over the past several decades, which have reflected the importance of the military to the nation. The National Security Act of 1947 and the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 institutionalized certain military officer roles, to include the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combatant Commanders, as powerful and influential voices within the government. Additionally, the military's experiences of prolonged and repeated deployments in the post-9/11 era have served to strengthen the military relative to other US institutions. Indeed, one scholar has claimed that the legislative changes wrought over the previous decades, combined with the past two decades of overseas experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, have had the practical effect of the Pentagon replacing the State Department as the government's "organizational center of gravity for U.S. national security and foreign policy" [@schmidt_silent_2019]. So great has the US military's institutional influence become, claims another scholar, that "Pentagon 'help' is like being hugged by an eight-hundred-pound gorilla: it can squeeze the life right out of civilian efforts" [@brooks_how_2016, 91]. 

Measuring the centrality or importance of the military is somewhat tricky. A good starting point is to examine the budget of the Department of Defense and of the individual military services, but here too, there are some important considerations. After all, even during the Cold War Era, the defense budget varied, and at times, significantly. The centrality and importance of the US military is best observed and understood from a point of view that examines major changes, or in some cases, lengthy periods of time. For example, while defense spending varied during the Cold War, at no point during the Cold War did defense spending decrease to a level that was on par with defense spending during the 1920s and 1930s [@vandenbroucke_which_2020]. Through this lens, the US military played a far more central role to the United States after World War Two and during the Cold War than during the 1920s and 1930s.  

As an indicator of the relative disparity between the Department of Defense and perhaps its closest institutional partner, the Department of State, Figure \@ref(fig:dodstate-budgets) displays each department's total budget in 2016 real dollars over the period from 1962-2016. One can clearly detect from the Figure that though the size of the Defense budget has dwarfed that of State for a number of decades, the relative degree to which the Defense budget is larger than the State Department's has grown sharply in the post-9/11 era.^[In the statistical portions of this dissertation, the predominant measures of military prestige used involve measurements of public trust and confidence in the military, as reported through various public opinion polling. The relative size of the DoD versus State Department Budget could also be used, but these budgetary differences likely also reflect institutional developments, such as the advent of the All-Volunteer Force, which is very expensive to maintain. Therefore, in my view, public opinion measurements of trust and confidence in the military are better (though still imperfect) measures of the military's overall level of prestige.]

### The Military's Growing Exclusivity Within American Society

A second factor of the military's overall high level of prestige involves society's perceptions of the military's skill and excellence. It is difficult to measure this directly, but perhaps the closest measurement involves the degree of public trust that Americans have placed in the military. By many measurements, the military is regarded today as the public's most trusted institution [@noauthor_confidence_2020]. 

While there is nothing inherently wrong with a military that is highly regarded by the public, contemporary scholars have expressed concern about the military being regarded _too highly_. Within the civil-military relations literature, the topic of the military's relational distance between the military and society is often referred to as the civil-military "gap" [@feaver_soldiers_2001]. For the past twenty years or so, numerous scholars have addressed the gap's origins, scope, and implications, and have raised numerous solutions for shrinking the gap [@feaver_soldiers_2001; @schake_warriors_2016]. Scholars further assert that in the years since the Vietnam War, at least three separate gaps have formed between the military and American society: a geographical gap [@liebert_midlife_2017], a partisan gap [@golby_duty_2011; @liebert_midlife_2017], and a generational gap [@colford_young_2016]. 

Before summarizing each of these three separate gaps, it is important to assert a couple of observations about the concept of a gap in general between society and the military. At first glance, one may think that a gap between society and the military might diminish, rather than enhance, the military's overall level of prestige. After all, a nation that is entirely separated from its military, in the sense that it is unable to observe, relate to, and know anything about the military or those that serve in it, is unlikely to foster appreciation and respect for the military as an institution. However, as I summarize in following paragraphs, most scholars have expressed the opposite concern: too large a gap between society and the military leads to society placing too much trust in -- or at least too much blind trust in -- the military. 

In the United States, the gap between society and the military has changed over time. In the American context, Americans have generally been suspicious of large numbers of standing military forces since the founding of the United States. In fact, the American founders held significant differences of opinion over how large the nation's military forces should be, and whether these forces should be comprised of volunteers (favored by Thomas Jefferson) or a standing military (favored by Alexander Hamilton) [@weigley_american_2001]. In the end, the founders established a hybrid concept, forming a moderately sized standing Army that could be augmented as required by state militias comprised of "citizen soldiers" [@weigley_american_2001]. 

Furthermore, for most of its history the United States has relied on a citizen-soldier concept when fielding military forces, especially for war. It was largely not until the 20th century that the government faced wartime demands requiring the institution of mandatory military service, particularly during World War Two, and later, Vietnam [@rostker_i_2006]. The Vietnam War proved to be tremendously unpopular with domestic American audiences as the length of the war increased, especially after the North Vietnamese initiated their "Tet Offensive" in 1968 [@crane_avoiding_2002; @summers_strategy_1982; @petraeus_american_1987]. Moreover, in the latter years of the war, Americans came to view the existing draft system as inequitable from racial and economic perspectives [@rostker_i_2006]. The growing population of the United States, combined with severe disciplinary issues that plagued many of the military services at the end of the war [@romjue_active_1984], led many Americans to believe that instituting an All-Volunteer Force (AVF) was at least a viable alternative to maintaining the draft [@rostker_i_2006]. The watershed moment arrived in 1973, when the United States formally abandoned the draft and created the All-Volunteer Force (AVF), the result of recommendations made by the Gates Commission, established previously by President Richard Nixon [@rostker_i_2006]. Since that time, only volunteers have served in the military. 

The first gap that scholars write about is a geographical gap between parts of the United States and the military. Golby and Liebert, for instance, note that a disproportionate number of those serving in the military hail from rural and southern states, and that a large proportion of military recruitment stations, Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs, and military installations are located in the southern United States [@liebert_midlife_2017]. The presence of this particular gap raises concerns that the military is disproportionately attached to particular regions of the country. 

A second gap that scholars have identified is a partisan gap between the military and portions of American society. This gap is a little more complicated to fully understand. Although the military officer corps does in fact disproportionately identify with the Republican Party versus the Democratic Party [@golby_duty_2011; @liebert_midlife_2017], studies have also shown that differences between the military and civilians become smaller if not altogether diminished after conditioning on partisan affiliation [@golby_duty_2011]. In other words, the data shows that the military officer corps does identify with the Republican Party more so than with the Democratic Party, but not that military and civilian values or goals are altogether drastically different from each other. 

Finally, and perhaps most problematically in terms of looking ahead into the future, studies have shown that a third gap exists between the military and younger Americans -- a gap that has grown as fewer Americans have a firsthand connection to someone either serving or who has served in the military [@colford_young_2016]. Such a gap is even reflected in recent surveys, which actually show the lowest rates of trust in the military are among those under "30 years of age" [@mcintyre_people_2021].

To the extent that these particular three gaps should, and actually do, matter is the subject of considerable debate. Several scholars argue that as the gap between society and the military has grown, it has simply become too easy to send the military to war, as there is little if any corresponding burden society must bear in doing so [@bacevich_breach_2014; @fallows_tragedy_2014]. Furthermore, these critics argue that as society's corresponding burden in going to war is reduced, the public decreasingly holds elected leaders accountable for going to war [@bacevich_breach_2014; @fallows_tragedy_2014]. The result is that the nation ultimately fights irresponsible wars of choice, which yield indecisive outcomes and an altogether feckless foreign policy [@bacevich_breach_2014]. 

As proof of their argument, these critics point to the military's post-9/11 involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan [@bacevich_breach_2014]. For instance, the historian Andrew Bacevich, himself a retired Army Colonel, points out that as the American military was invading and stabilizing Afghanistan and Iraq in 2001 and 2003 respectively, President George W. Bush lowered taxes and encouraged Americans to travel [@bacevich_breach_2014]. Bacevich further asserts that the net result of the military enduring repeated deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, and achieving outcomes in these places that fall far short of strategic victory, is that "the state now owns war, with the country consigned to observer status" [@bacevich_breach_2014, 44]. Furthermore, this sentiment has likewise been captured by the journalist James Fallows, who, in an influential article, alleges that Americans in the post-9/11 era have developed a "reverent but disengaged attitude toward the military -- we love the Troops, but we'd rather not think about them" [@fallows_tragedy_2014].

In addition to its impacts on American foreign policy, other scholars worry that an excessive gap between society and the military harms the quality of civil-military dialogue by constraining civilian input into the policy process, which in turn can likewise threaten a range of foreign policy outcomes. When interacting with civilian leaders in the context of a sizable gap between the military and society, certain military actors may adopt an attitude such that they believe their military service entitles them to be heard in a deferential manner [@beehner_matter_2020]. A similar dynamic can occur if civilian leaders fail to sufficiently assert themselves into the policy process when interacting with military actors who are incredibly popular. Karlin and Friend, for instance, note the dynamic of "military worship" in which military service is somehow viewed as better, more relevant, or more appropriate than other types of civilian service, which ultimately harms civilian control of the military and other democratic norms [@friend_military_2018]. As a result, military actors may insist on solving problems in the manner that they want the job done, and not in a way that aligns with the desire of civilian leaders.

```

While recent polls show that trust in the military may in fact be slipping [@mcintyre_people_2021], the fact is that relative to other institutions, Americans greatly respect their military. According to recent Gallup public opinion polls, 72 percent of Americans indicate that they trust the military a "great deal" or "quite a lot" -- the most of any institution, to include Congress (13%), the Presidency (39%), the police (48%), the Supreme Court (40%), and the church/organized religion (42%) [@noauthor_confidence_2020]. Moreover, trends in trust of various American institutions over time reveal that, whereas trust in the military has generally increased over the past 45 years, trust in the other institutions has generally declined or remained the same. These trends are displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:insttrust).

In this dissertation, I argue that a high level of military prestige provides civilian and military actors with an opportunity to leverage public opinion, and thus, with an opportunity to behave in such a way that disregards the principles of civil-military relations. The next section of this chapter describes how the respective levels of polarization and military prestige combine to form unique domestic political environments that impact the constraining influence of the central principles of civil-military relations on the civilian and military actors who practice them. 

\singlespace
## How Polarization and Prestige Impact the Central Principles of Civil-Military Relations
\doublespace

Having defined both the dependent and independent variables in this chapter, and having defined the central principles of civil-military relations in the previous chapter, I now blend these elements to form a cohesive theory. In broad terms, I argue that high levels of political polarization provide a _motive_ for military leaders to engage in political behaviors that challenge the central principles of civil-military relations, while a high level of military prestige provides both military and civilian leaders with an _opportunity_ to do the same  [@finer_man_1962]. 

This section proceeds in three parts. First, I argue how high levels of polarization provide a _motive_ for military actors to engage in political behaviors that violate the principles of civil-military relations. I then argue how high levels of military prestige provide an _opportunity_ for civilian and military actors to do the same. Finally, I argue that the combination of relative levels of polarization and military prestige lead to the formulation of four distinct domestic political environments in which civil-military relations occur. In this section, I describe how each environment corresponds to unique differences in the ways in which civilian and military actors adhere to the central principles of civil-military relations, and the specific forms of political behaviors we can expect each actor type to engage in. The central implication of this theory is that certain aspects of the domestic political environment -- namely, the level of polarization and the level of military prestige -- significantly shape the degree to which militaries become involved in politics, either by their own will, or through that of civilian leaders who seek the military's involvement in politics.

### Polarization - A "Motive" to Challenge the Principles of Civil-Military Relations
\doublespace

Increasing polarization serves as a _motive_ for military actors to behave in ways that violate the central principles of civil-military relations. This occurs because highly polarized political climates signify not merely political differences within a community, but increasing division and incompatibility regarding the underlying moral values, worldviews, and fundamental aims and purposes that should influence and govern the state and society. Thus, as polarization rises, military actors increasingly encounter situations in which they must make judgments about whether to abide by the fundamental principles of civil-military relations, or to engage in acts of behavior that, while violating the central governing principles of civil-military relations, nonetheless advance a particular belief system, set of values, or ideology that a particular military leader supports. In the paragraphs which follow, I deliberately use the term military officer rather than military actor to denote that as commissioned leaders, officers are the particular type of military actor who are most likely to encounter the friction that I describe. This is not intended to denigrate enlisted personnel, or veterans, or other types of military actors, but rather to illustrate that military officers are the most likely to serve in a position of military authority while having to respond to growing friction captured by rising polarization. 

If American military officers could exist in a figurative and theoretical vacuum, polarization may not have the impact I claim it does. But the fact is that military officers are part of the American society that they serve. Before they join the military, military officers are young men and women who grow up somewhere. Like the rest of American society as a whole, military actors collectively become polarized as different worldviews and ideologies compete for supremacy in the political square.^[I am not stating that every military officer will become polarized in the sense that every officer will hold extreme views. My point here is that in a collective sense, as society becomes polarized, so does the officer corps, generally speaking.] Furthermore, after joining the military, each military officer further develops his or her own worldview, and relies on certain moral values to help guide his or her behavior. When worldviews are increasingly at odds with each other, military officers will encounter greater friction as they execute their routine duties. Such friction can manifest in a number of ways.  

One might immediately counter at this point, claiming that military officers have always experienced tension when facing situations in which they must choose between maintaining their professional responsibilities or following the dictates of their personal conscience. Indeed, scholars and military officers have long recognized such a dynamic as an inherently tricky yet crucial aspect of the military profession and of military officership in particular [@cohn_what_2019; @robinson_dissents_2020].^[For a context of dealing with this tension in war, see @dubik_just_2016.] Indeed, military officers sometimes encounter situations in which choosing to be loyal to one entity -- whether it be a civilian leader, the American people, the Constitution, one's fellow soldiers, or himself/herself -- comes at the direct actual or perceived exclusion of another [@cohn_what_2019; @robinson_dissents_2020]. How to operate in an environment in such an environment is never easy, and scholars and practitioners take differing views on the matter. Some scholars and officers assert that civilians should and must always be followed [@kohn_richard_2010], while others argue that military officers, as moral agents, should never follow an order which they believe is inherently wrong [@milburn_breaking_2010; @milburn_when_2019].

Rising political polarization accentuates these dynamics in two significant ways, however. First, highly polarized environments increase the frequency with which military officers encounter situations in which they have to choose between supporting and obeying their civilian leaders or following the dictates of their own moral conscience. In other words, rising polarization ultimately leads to a problem of authority, and specifically, who or what is the highest authority that military officers will obey. Second, highly polarized environments increase the magnitude of the disparity that exists in these choices because the difference in outcomes (e.g., obeying and supporting a civilian leader or following one's conscience) is more likely to involve not merely a minor difference in political opinions, but a difference in worldviews, moral values, and the fundamental aims and purposes that should govern American society.  

As military officers more frequently encounter situations in which the disparity between compliance and following one's conscience grows, we can expect them to increasingly behave in ways that support the worldview and moral values they hold dear, and likely resulting in failure to adhere to the central principles of civil-military relations. While it is not possible to predict all of the issue areas or situations which could provide a _motive_ for military actors to challenge the governing principles of civil-military relations, it is possible to trace how and why the characteristics of today's highly polarized environment in the United States might compel some military officers to challenge the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference of the military. 

As polarization rises, some military officers will be willing to violate the principle of civilian control when they deem that the preferred policies held and promulgated by a particular civilian leader or administration are not simply politically unwise, but wrong in a moral sense. If rising polarization reflects differences about what moral values and worldviews are to govern the nation and society, then the definition of which orders or policies are immoral will increasingly depend on the worldview and moral values held by a particular military officer relative to those espoused and promulgated by a civilian leader. Furthermore, military doctrine regarding officership and ethics has long noted the immense role of morality in guiding the behavior and conduct of military officers [@united_states_army_adp_2019]. For example, Army Doctrinal Publication 6-22, entitled, _Leadership and the Profession_, states that, "The Army ethic has its origins in the philosophical heritage, theological and cultural traditions, and the historical legacy that frame our nation" [@united_states_army_adp_2019, 1-7]. But the problem is that during periods of heightened polarization, these moral-ethical origins are no longer agreed upon and/or cherished by a majority of people, or are being redefined, or are jettisoned and being replaced by other worldviews and values that may, at least to some officers, run counter to those that they espouse.

In a similar vein, some military officers may be willing to violate the principle of non-partisanship if they believe that one of the major political parties possesses an agenda that is not simply wiser from a political perspective than the other party, but rather one which aligns to the moral views of the officer on a particular issue or set of issues. Finally, some military officers might be motivated to violate a standard of "non-interference" of the military into certain areas of state policy if they believe that the military as an institution should play a greater role in advancing the underlying ideology or values associated with a particular issue or set of issues.  

In summary, periods of heightened political polarization can create a _motive_ for the military to engage in behaviors that violate the central principles of civil-military relations because a high level of political polarization represents a battle over which worldviews will prevail, or which will lose sway. Military officers may be trained to uphold the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference, but they are also part of American society, both before and after joining the military, thus developing their opinions and stances on the same political issues as do ordinary Americans. When the political topics of the day reflect differing moral worldviews, military officers are unlikely to stay silent. From an early rank, American officers are taught to rely on their moral reasoning to help guide their conduct, as doing so enables military officers to lead and act in periods of great stress, such as combat [@united_states_army_adp_2019]. 

Thus, during periods of heightened polarization, an increasing number of military officers will behave in ways that violate the principles of civil-military relations. These behaviors are deliberate actions, in my view. The military officer who engages in behavior that violates the principles of civil-military relations on the basis of moral principle is fully aware of the impacts of his or her behavior, even if the officer is reluctant to engage in the particular behavior. At some point, as polarization rises,  a military officer will prioritize the worldview and underlying ideology to which he or she subscribes over and above adherence to the central principles of civil-military relations. 

### The Military and Race in Contemporary America

Among the clearest contemporary examples of polarization providing a "motive" for military actors to engage in political behaviors which violate the principles of civil-military relations is the issue of race in America. For any observer or participant of American politics over the past several years, it comes as no surprise that the issue of race has become one of the most polarizing political issues in the United States.^[In many ways, and as the first case study describes, this is not an entirely new issue. The military has played a central role within issues that pertain to race, including desegregation of the Armed Forces.] The military, along with many other institutions, such as primary education, corporate America and business, and religious establishments such as the church, has been thrust into discussions involving race in America and what to do about it.  

At the risk of summarizing what is a topic that deserves a much fuller and lengthier treatment than can be given here, I will attempt to capture why the military and the issue of race have collided so drastically over the past few years, and to show how they have done so. In articulating this example, my aim is to demonstrate how the issue of race has served as a _motive_ for some military officers to engage in behaviors that violate, or at least challenge, the principles of civil-military relations. Furthermore, the key to understanding why this has been the case is in understanding that the events and discussions that have made race in America such a visible issue over the past several years have ignited different worldviews, values, and ideologies among military officers (like the nation itself) on the topic of race.  
Recent Pew Research public opinion data (2021) reveals just how split Americans are over the issue of race and what to do about it. Of Americans surveyed in July of 2021, 49% said that "a little" (34%) or "nothing at all" (15%) needs to be done "to ensure equal rights for all Americans regardless of their racial or ethnic background" [@pew_research_center_deep_2021]. In the same survey, however, 50% of those said that "a lot" needs to be done to advance the same [@pew_research_center_deep_2021]. Moreover, among the 50% who believe that "a lot" needs to be done to ensure equal rights for all, respondents were split with respect to whether current systems could accommodate the changes that needed to be made, or whether "most US laws/institutions need to be completely rebuilt" [@pew_research_center_deep_2021]. 

It is difficult to find any place, organization, or work space today that is not somehow impacted by discussions revolving around race. The military is no exception, and strong opinions abound whether these developments and the approaches that have been implemented to achieve racial harmony actually harm or help. What cannot be denied is that beliefs and convictions on the issue of race increasingly compel behavior that aligns with one's view on this topic (and other polarizing topics). For instance, in the wake of the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, 2020, multiple high ranking military officers penned opinion pieces that, while directly addressing President Trump's handling of protests across the United States, also more broadly revealed their own perspectives on race in the United States [@brooks_let_2020]. For example, Retired Admiral Mike Mullen, a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, penned an article in _The Atlantic_ shortly after these events occurred entitled, "I Cannot Remain Silent," in which he blasted President Trump's reported use of the National Guard to clear a path through Lafayette Square in order for the President to walk to nearby St. John's Church for a photo.^[In June of 2021, interestingly, the Inspector General of the US Department of the Interior issued a report in which he did not and could not corroborate any finding suggesting that Trump had given the order to use US Capitol Police to clear the park, and that the plan to clear the park had been in place for hours before Trump's walk from the Rose Garden to the church. See @montanaro_watchdog_2021 for more details.] In the article, however, Mullen further stated, "We must, as citizens, address head-on the issue of police brutality and sustained injustices against the African American community" [@mullen_i_2020]. 

This last sentence is clear evidence of Mullen's worldview, and it explains, at least in part, why he was willing to write an opinion piece that strongly and directly criticized a sitting President. The title itself, "I Cannot Remain Silent," describes how Mullen prioritized his worldview and his personal values over adhering to the principle of civilian control of the military, which likely would have resulted in either not writing the piece to begin with, or at least couching the piece in softer language that did not directly criticize the former President. To be clear, my aim here is neither to claim that Mullen was wrong for writing the piece, nor that he was right to do so, but rather to suggest that at a minimum, Mullen's personal decision to write the piece and to criticize the former President in the process flowed directly from his personal worldview regarding race in the United States and what should be done about it. 

The topic of race in America is likely to remain a motive for military officers to behave in ways that violate principles of civil-military relations for some time. More than a year after the death of George Floyd and the aftermath that followed, race in America remains a visibly hot topic, even in the military. Indeed, more than a year after Mullen's publication, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, appeared before Congress to answer questions regarding the military and its supposed stance on _Critical Race Theory_ (CRT). Critical Race Theory is something that most Americans had never heard of before 2020, but in recent months, debates about what Critical Race Theory is, and whether and how it should be implemented and applied in American institutions, have been extensive.^[I do not have the space to unpack CRT, or _Critical Theory_ in general, in this dissertation, nor is that my goal. What is interesting, however, is the extent to which multiple institutions of nearly every flavor are debating, criticizing, or commenting on CRT. For example, evangelical churches are sharply divided over whether Critical Theory is even compatible with their religious doctrines. See, for instance, @allen_why_2020 and @baucham_fault_2021 and two evangelical leaders who offer strong warnings against the church adopting views on social justice that are compatible with _Critical Theory._ See also  @belkin_mask_2021 for an example of the role of CRT in school board battles ahead of the Virginia Gubernatorial Election, an election that many contemporary political observers interpreted as a resounding defeat of progressive education policies that aggressively implemented CRT. See also @saunders_behind_2021 for a confirmatory view, but also @saletan_what_2021 for a more nuanced view.] During the hearing, General Milley greatly angered Republican Members of Congress when he essentially stated that the military does not teach CRT, but that it remains a topic that should be learned and read about so as to better educate American military officers [@kurtzleben_joint_2021].

The bottom line is that the issue of race in America may serve as a motive for some military actors to engage in behaviors that challenge the governing standards of civil-military relations, depending on where a particular military officer stands with respect to the issue of race in America. Those who strongly believe that the lack of relative proportional minority representation among senior general and flag officers and among key occupations such as fighter pilots constitutes proof of a pernicious form of racism that still exists are more likely to behave in ways that affirm such a view. Other military actors who believe that the presence of these dynamics are the result of other underlying factors, such as selection of certain types of military roles that are correlated with race and socioeconomic background, are more likely to behave in ways that affirm these viewpoints [see, for instance, @dinick_race_2021]. 

Debates over these differing ideologies, worldviews, and things like CRT are not likely to remain merely philosophical or ethereal debates for members of the military. Indeed, differences over these particular issues impact how the military functions and operates. Consider the military's promotion system, and how different worldviews and ideologies lead different people to institute various policies. In June of 2020, Trump's Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, announced that the Department of Defense would remove all photographs of personnel as they are considered for promotion, in order "to ensure promotion boards and selection processes enable equal opportunity for all service members, promote diversity in our ranks, and are free from bias on race, ethnicity, gender, or national origin" [Mark Esper quoted in @schogol_dod_2020]. Such a policy is likely to please those who disagree with the assertions and goals of CRT, and who would affirm a _colorblind_ approach to combat racism. At the same time, such a policy is inherently against the assertions of proponents and advocates of CRT. Just a year later, some leaders in the Navy and Marine Corps announced that removing the photographs from promotion boards has hindered the Navy from achieving its goals with respect to diversity, and therefore, that the photos should be reinstated. For instance, Vice Admiral John Newell remarked at a panel on the topic of diversity in 2021, "I think we should consider reinstating photos in selection boards...we can show you where, as you look at diversity, it went down with photos removed" [Newell quoted in @toropin_navys_2021]. 

This example serves as just one timely and relevant example of how different ideologies can impact, and have impacted, the behavior of various military actors as their personal worldviews and moral values are thrust into the political spotlight.^[There are many examples of how different views regarding race have generated friction within the US military. One example involves a letter penned to the leaders of the United States Military Academy by several recent graduates alleging the systemic racism of West Point; see @askew_anti-racist_2020 for the original letter and more details. How one interprets this letter is largely a function of one's belief about the issue of race in the United States. See @dreher_wokeness_2020 for a right-of-center analysis of this letter and its implications.] The example of Admiral Mullen as a retired senior military officer blatantly criticizing a sitting US President shows how polarizing environments can lead to military officers behaving in ways that support the worldview, ideology, and moral values that they hold to, even as such behavior also violates one or more of the principles of civil-military relations. 

Does increasing polarization mean that civilian actors will also increasingly violate the central principles of civil-military relations? In my view, no, it does not. The main reason for this is that rising polarization by itself does not automatically denote that civilians will seek to employ the military in necessarily controversial ways, or in the pursuit of partisan ends related to highly polarizing issues. To be clear, there are numerous historical instances in which the military finds itself at or near the center of polarizing and controversial political issues. For example, the military played a major role during Reconstruction at the end of the Civil War, and the military has played a sizable role in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in modern times, which has certainly been a bitter and polarizing issue across the United States. These are both examples of the military finding itself at or near highly polarizing issues, in which case, I think it is reasonable to suspect that civilian actors might increasingly violate central principles of civil-military relations. But the military is not at the center of every polarizing topic. 

Pew Research Center polling conducted in 2020, for instance, found that among the most polarizing topics in the US today are climate change, gun control, the environment, and immigration [@pew_research_center_environmental_2020]. Other public opinion research has found that issues such as abortion are now more polarizing in the US than they have been in several decades [@blazina_key_2021]. The theory I have offered thus far affirms that members of the military, like the public, are strongly divided over all of these listed issue areas. But it is not necessarily the case that civilian leaders will use the military, directly or indirectly, to achieve their desired policy goals in each of these areas. For example, of those described above, only immigration and to a lesser degree, climate change, have directly intersected with the military. This is not to say that future gun control and environmental policies do not and will not impact the military, but rather that to date, these issues have not induced significant military action or involvement.^[Furthermore, one does not have to imagine scenarios that are too far flung to ascertain that significant civil-military strife could follow if the military were to be used in a greater way over any number of polarizing issues. Hypothetically, if a future President were to order active-duty forces to secure abortion clinics within the United States, there would likely be significant tension, if not between the President and military leaders, then at least among political parties and press outlets.] Thus, rising polarization weakens the constraining influence of the central principles of civil-military relations for military actors, but not necessarily for civilian actors.

### Prestige - An "Opportunity" to Challenge the Principles of Civil-Military Relations
\doublespace

Rising military prestige, on the other hand, offers an _opportunity_ for both civilian and military actors to engage in behaviors that violate the central principles of civil-military relations. This stems from the connection between rising prestige and its perceived influence on the _potential_ to impact public opinion. Note that for purposes of this theory, rising military prestige need only increase the _potential_ of the military to impact public opinion, not necessarily the _efficacy_ to actually do so.^[Scholarship has examined whether using the military, or specific military actors, actually can sway the public. The results are not conclusive. See @golby_military_2012 and @golby_listening_2013 for two such studies.]  

A significant amount of scholarship in the subject area of political communication describes how, why, and the extent to which elites can influence public opinion [for a sampling of this scholarship, see @saunders_no_2017; @guisinger_mapping_2017; @baum_relationships_2008; and @kertzer_bottom-up_2017]. Scholars differ on the degree to which elites actually impact public opinion; nonetheless, the literature shows that in general, the public looks to elites who are "knowledgeable" and "trustworthy" when thinking about which public voices to listen to [@lupia_democratic_1998, 69-76]. Scholars also claim that the more elites are perceived by the public to hold the attribute of credibility (broadly speaking), the greater capacity these elites have to "cue" public opinion [@zaller_nature_1992, 47].

Viewed through the lens of varying levels of military prestige, we can now project this scholarship onto the ability of trusted military elites (and perhaps the military institution in general) to impact public opinion. It is reasonable to consider that the more prestigious a military becomes, the more that military leaders will be considered to be "knowledgeable and trustworthy" [@lupia_democratic_1998, 69-76]. This is especially true if we conceptualize military prestige as the degree of trust placed in it by the public, which I have argued, earlier in this chapter, is a good proxy for military prestige. Thus, during periods in which military prestige is high, both civilian and military actors have an _opportunity_ to use the military to attempt to influence public opinion. What is described largely mirrors what Risa Brooks (2009) describes as the "latent political influence" of the military [@brooks_militaries_2009, 231]. Periods of high military prestige, therefore, result in the potential for civilian and military actors to behave in ways that attempt to leverage the military's high standing to alter public opinion.

We may certainly expect that civilian actors will be responsive to rising levels of military prestige. After all, a primary motivation of political actors is to remain in office [@strom_behavioral_1990]. Furthermore, previous scholarship extensively shows that leader credibility, in any number of domestic and international contexts, is important [@saunders_no_2017]. Thus, if and when civilian actors believe that engaging in behaviors that harness a prestigious military will improve their electoral chances, these civilians are more likely to engage in these behaviors, even if they violate one or more of the principles of civil-military relations in the process. 

But there is ample reason to suspect that military actors are also responsive to rising levels of military prestige. If military actors know that they are increasingly valued, trusted, and esteemed by society, they are more likely to behave in ways that violate one or more of the principles of civil-military relations. This could be because highly esteemed military actors believe that the public who values them will overlook or forgive such behavior, or that as a highly trusted and respected voice in the nation, they have an increasing duty to act as the saviors or guardians of the country [@finer_man_1962; @fitch_armed_1998, 129]. Regardless of the reasons for which it occurs, higher military prestige results in a greater likelihood that military actors will behave in ways that challenge the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference of the military. At first glance, the fact that civilians are responsive to high levels of military prestige seems to fit several instances in US history. Indeed, popular military figures have influenced public opinion in significant ways and in a variety of different periods. Generals Ulysses S. Grant and Dwight D. Eisenhower, for instance, were both wartime commanders who, largely as a result of the popularity they commanded with the public for an extended period of time in uniform, ultimately ascended to the Presidency [@teigen_why_2018]. 

In summary, high levels of military prestige present an _opportunity_ for civilian and military actors to use the military as an instrument to impact public opinion. This can result in both civilian and military actors engaging in behaviors that violate the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference of the military institution. These behaviors, as the examples listed below illustrate, can take a variety of forms.  

### Examples of Use of the Military to Sway Public Opinion

Instances of civilian and military actors using the military during periods of high military prestige in United States history to sway public opinion abound. In the paragraphs below, I give two examples. The first involves the well-known instance of General Colin Powell who, as the sitting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in late 1992 - early 1993, wrote several opinion pieces as Bill Clinton assumed the presidency. These opinion pieces essentially argued that the military should not drastically intervene in the Balkans and other similar post-Cold War crises --- an effort to influence US national security policy. The second involves the use of retired military officers to speak at the 2016 Democratic and Republic political conventions, respectively. 

The first example illustrates an instance in which a high degree of personal prestige surrounding a single military actor facilitated that actor behaving in a way that violated the principle of civilian control. The second example illustrates an instance in which broader institutional military prestige facilitated behavior engaged in by both civilian actors (the political candidates and their campaign teams who sought military actors to speak on their behalf at each party's convention) and military actors (the retired military officers who agreed to speak), and which violated the principle of military non-partisanship. Both examples together are intended to illustrate how a high degree of military prestige -- either at the personal or institutional level -- provides an _opportunity_ for both military and civilian actors to engage in political behaviors that violate the central principles of civil-military relations. 

General Colin Powell, while still on active duty, wrote two major opinion commentary pieces in 1992 and 1993 that challenged Bill Clinton's views regarding the use of military force in the Balkans [@powell_opinion_1992; @powell_us_1992]. The timing of these pieces is important. Powell's editorial in the _New York Times_ was written just weeks before Election Day in 1992, and his _Foreign Affairs_ piece was published later that winter, right as Bill Clinton assumed the presidency. Perhaps Powell cleared the content of both pieces with the Bush Administration, which was still in charge when these opinion pieces were likely submitted for consideration. But what is important from the perspective of the three central principles of civil-military relations is that even if Powell did allow the Bush administration to review the content of his articles, Powell at a very minimum knew that airing his views in a public manner would generate political costs for Clinton, if elected. 

This is because the content of Powell's opinion pieces contradicted many foreign policy views held by Clinton and members of his cabinet. For instance, Powell's _New York Times_ editorial entitled, "Why Generals Get Nervous," explicitly stated that, "In Bosnia, there are no clear military goals," [@powell_opinion_1992] and his piece in _Foreign Affairs_ stated that a potential mission of sending US military forces lacked "clear and unambiguous objectives" [@powell_us_1992, 38]. On the other hand, Madeline Albright, Clinton's Ambassador to the United Nations and later, Secretary of State, felt more optimistic about the goals that American military forces could achieve in the Balkans and other trouble spots around the world. In a 2006 interview, Albright recalled the way in which Powell would frame military choices in rather stark terms for Clinton's foreign policy team. Albright recalls that, "On a regular basis Colin would come in and do a presentation...he’d go through this and say, 'We can take that hill and we can do that and we can do this. You know we have the best military in the world, but it’s going to take 500,000 men and $500 billion and 50 years.' So he’d lead you up the hill of possibilities and then drop you off the other side, and you’d end up with no options" [@albright_william_2006]. 

By the mid-1990s, Powell was no longer Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but by appealing to the American public through opinion commentary as Clinton came into office and by framing military options in excessively black and white terms for the new administration, Powell not only steered public opinion against the possibility of American military intervention in Bosnia, at least initially, but he also likely made the option increasingly unappealing to policymakers behind closed doors. Perhaps Powell's advice was wise and even accurate, at least in some respects. Yet his actions, I contend, also violated the fundamental principle of civilian control of the military in that it did not allow the Commander in Chief to genuinely consider and weigh a full range of possible policy options with which to respond to multiple developing crises in the world after the end of the Cold War.  

There is no "smoking gun" that explains Powell's behavior other than the fact that he felt strongly that the commitment of a large contingent of US military forces to Bosnia was a mistake. That said, for the purposes of the theory offered here, it is reasonable to conclude that Powell's actions were facilitated by the enormous degree of personal clout and prestige he carried. Powell was a charismatic, well spoken, educated, and likable figure who had become increasingly well known in the wake of the US victory over Iraq in the Gulf War. Powell likely believed that by engaging in the public behaviors that he did, a significant portion of the public would not only agree with his stance on military intervention in Bosnia, but be willing to either overlook or forgive any perceived breach of protocol insofar as military figures eschewing the political spotlight. In this way, Powell's high personal prestige afforded him an _opportunity_ to behave in the way that he did. 

A second and different example involves Army Lieutenant General Mike Flynn and Marine Corps General John Allen, each of whom, as retired officers, spoke at the respective Republican and Democratic Conventions in 2016. Regardless of what they said at the convention (Flynn is known for leading chants of "lock her up," referring to the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton), the act of speaking at an event that is inherently partisan violated the principle of non-partisanship of the military. In the aftermath of these conventions, Retired Army General Martin Dempsey, who had recently served as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, published an opinion-editorial piece in _The Washington Post_ in which he criticized both the retired officers and the candidates who had asked them to speak. Dempsey argued in his op-ed, "As generals, they have an obligation to uphold our apolitical traditions. They have just made the task of their successors –- who continue to serve in uniform and are accountable for our security -- more complicated. It was a mistake for them to participate as they did. _It was a mistake for our presidential candidates to ask them to do so_" [@dempsey_military_2016, emphasis mine; see also @exum_dangerous_2017]. 

In this example, the military institution's relatively high prestige likely provided an _opportunity_ for Flynn, Allen, and the civilian leaders who asked each of these generals to speak to violate the principle of military non-partisanship. Neither Flynn nor Allen were household names at the time, and it is doubtful that most Americans could identify either general's photograph today. It is more likely the case that each of the political candidates and their campaign organizers sought a military general's public endorsement because each believed that having a high ranking military voice would prove politically advantageous. Furthermore, both officers who agreed to speak also likely did so, at least in part, because each officer believed that he could influence public opinion and ultimately advance the political prospects of each candidate proceeding to the presidency. I am not suggesting that the high level of polarization that prevailed in 2016 was also not a factor in the officer agreeing to speak; indeed, the theory I have offered would instead affirm that high polarization played a large role in shaping and contributing to each officer's behavior. Rather, I am pointing out that first, it is highly unlikely that either general would have been asked to speak in the first place at either of these conventions had the military as an institution not commanded relatively high prestige at the time of the party conventions in 2016; and second, that each officer likely agreed to speak _at least in part_ because he believed he could impact public opinion, at least to some degree, because the institution with which each officer was primarily affiliated -- the military -- was highly prestigious.    

In summary, high military prestige reflects how important the military is to the nation and how esteemed it is by the public. The institution itself can be highly prestigious, but so can individuals, particularly among those who lead the institution. As military prestige rises, the _potential_ for the military to influence or sway public opinion rises. Therefore, civilian and military actors will increasingly engage in political behaviors in order to influence public opinion when the level of military prestige is high, even if doing so violates one or more of the central principles of civil-military relations. For emphasis, the theory advanced here is not concerned with whether high military prestige _actually_ translates into increased efficacy for the military or military actors to sway public opinion. Rather, I am simply arguing that when military prestige is high, civilian and military actors are more likely to believe the military can sway public opinion, and will therefore behave in ways that seek to do so. Viewed through this lens, rising military prestige thus provides an _opportunity_ for civilian and military actors to use the military to intervene in politics.

### Polarization and Prestige Generate Four Types of Domestic Structures
\doublespace

If high levels of polarization signify that military leaders have a _motive_ to intervene in politics, and if high levels of military prestige afford both civilian and military leaders an _opportunity_ to use the military to engage in political behaviors, it follows that a total of four broad types of domestic structures emerge. These four structures are displayed in Table \@ref(tab:poss-environment). Given the presence or absence of _motives_ and _opportunities_ in each environment, we can expect variation in each quadrant along two primary axes: the predominant type of actor committing political behaviors, and the overall severity or level of the political activities that occur.   

```{r poss-environment, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}

  "High Prestige", "Military and Civilian (induced) politicization; moderate levels of political activity; high potential for civil-military conflict", 
  "Comprehensive politicization; extreme levels of political activity; significant potential for civil-military conflict"

  column_spec(1, width="8em") %>% 
  column_spec(2:3, width="18em") 
```

### Low Polarization, Low Military Prestige

In this environment, military actors lack an ideological _motive_ to intervene in politics, and both civilian and military actors lack an _opportunity_ to harness the military in ways that seek to leverage public opinion. This leads to the theoretical expectation that while there might certainly be conflict between military and civilian leaders in this type of domestic environment, there will likely be neither widespread nor highly visible instances of political behavior committed by either military or civilian actors that challenge or violate the standards or principles of civil-military relations. The political behaviors that occur in this environment are relatively tame in that they do not generate significant civil-military tension. Historical examples in the United States of this domestic structure include the post-Vietnam (roughly 1973-1990) and immediate pre-World War Two (roughly 1936-1944) eras.

### High Polarization, Low Military Prestige

When polarization is high but military prestige is low, military actors genuinely possess a _motive_ to engage in political behaviors that threaten or violate the central principles of civil-military relations. However, as a result of the low level of military prestige that exists in this type of domestic structure, civilian and military actors lack the _opportunity_ to use the military in ways that leverage public opinion. This leads to the theoretical expectation that in this environment, military actors in particular will engage in political behaviors. Civilian actors in this environment  are unlikely to induce political behavior involving the military. Furthermore, the overall level of political activity that occurs in such an environment accords with moderate risk for civil-military conflict. A historical example of this era includes the years between the end of American Reconstruction and the start of the Spanish American War (roughly 1877 - 1898).

### Low Polarization, High Military Prestige

In a domestic structure where polarization is low, but military prestige is high, military actors lack an ideological _motive_ to intervene politically. However, because military prestige is high, both civilian and military actors possess an _opportunity_ to use the military to leverage public opinion. This leads to the theoretical expectation that under these conditions, both actor types are likely to engage in visible political behaviors involving the military institution. Furthermore, because both sets of actors might seek to employ the military to influence public opinion, the potential for civil-military conflict in this domestic structure is high. 

Broad examples of this period include portions of the post-World War Two era until the end of the Vietnam War (roughly 1945-1973) and the post-Gulf War period (roughly 1991-2009). Several historical civil-military relations crises occurred under these conditions, including a major dispute between between President Truman and General Douglas MacArthur in 1951, another between General Matthew Ridgeway and President Eisenhower over the role of nuclear weapons and American's "New Look" policy, and yet another between President Bill Clinton and General Colin Powell in the early 1990s. 

### High Polarization, High Military Prestige

When polarization and military prestige are both high, military actors possess a _motive_ to intervene politically, and both military and civilian actors possess an _opportunity_ to involve the military in ways that are intended to leverage public opinion. Under these conditions, military actors are increasingly willing to behave in ways that violate the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference. Furthermore, both military and civilian actors have an _opportunity_ to use the military to appeal to the public. This leads to the theoretical expectation that both actor types, military and civilian, will engage in highly visible political behaviors that challenge the principles of civil-military relations. Accordingly, there is significant potential for civil-military conflict in this domestic structure. 

Examples of this period include the immediate post-US Civil War period during the start of American Reconstruction (roughly 1865-1868) as well as in the modern era (roughly 2010-2021). These conditions are also associated with a number of recent and historical civil-military relations disputes, including between President Andrew Johnson, General Ulysses S. Grant, and Congress for control of the military as an institution in the early years of American Reconstruction, and recent tension between the military under the leadership of President's Trump and Biden in the present day. 

Based on the theoretical predictions that follow from Table \@ref(tab:poss-environment), it is possible to derive the following five hypotheses: 

### Hypotheses to be Tested

H1: Military actors increasingly violate the central principles of civil-military relations when polarization is high relative to periods of low polarization. 

H2: Military actors increasingly violate the central principles of civil-military relations in public and visible ways when military prestige is high relative to periods of low military prestige. 

H3: Civilian actors increasingly violate the central principles of civil-military relations when military prestige is high relative to periods of low military prestige. 

H4: Military and civilian actors engage in relatively more visible and public forms of political behavior that involve the military institution when military prestige is high relative to periods of low military prestige. 

H5: The most extreme levels of overall political activity occur in environments that are characterized by simultaneously high levels of political polarization and military prestige.  

## Endogeneity and Alternate Explanations

This section highlights the extent to which endogeneity poses a concern for the theory offered thus far. Additionally, this section addresses several alternate explanations. In doing so, I explore what other factors -- instead of polarization and military prestige -- could be responsible for driving variation in the willingness of actors to adhere to the central principles of civil-military relations, and thus, variation in instances of political behaviors that threaten these principles. 

First, I address endogeneity. In doing so, I examine the degree to which the theory that I have thus far argued works the other way. That is, I ask if instead of polarization and military prestige driving variation in civilian and military political behaviors that threaten the principles of civil-military relations, is it possible that the behaviors themselves drive the levels of political polarization and military prestige? Second, I raise and discuss several factors that could serve as alternate explanations responsible for the level of political activity that violates the principles of civil-military relations. Ultimately, I conclude that concerns over endogeneity are present, but to a mild degree, and that such concerns greatly diminish (though they do not disappear) when the independent and dependent variables are strictly operationalized and defined. With respect to potential alternate explanations, I conclude that there are several other plausible factors, the greatest of which is norm change. Nonetheless, as I argue below, this (and other) potential alternate explanations do not significantly cast suspicion on the theory offered thus far.  

### Endogeneity Concerns 

As King, Keohane, and Verba (1994) note, endogeneity is a "common and serious problem" in the social sciences, especially in non-experimental settings [@king_designing_1994]. As this dissertation relies entirely on observational and historical methods, rather than experimental methods, endogeneity poses a genuine concern that must be both acknowledged and dealt with. Endogeneity essentially involves the "direction" of causality, or how the variables that comprise a theory work in a sequence [@king_designing_1994]. While there are many different types of endogeneity, all forms generate concerns that the relationship between a particular set of independent variables and a dependent variable is not, in reality, what the researcher concludes it is [see Chapter 11 of @gerring_social_2012 for a description of different types of trouble that endogeneity poses]. 

Applying concerns about endogeneity to the theory that has been offered thus far in this chapter involves asking whether it is possible that instead of the levels of polarization and military prestige driving the political behaviors committed by civilian and military actors that challenge the principles of civil-military relations, which I have argued, is it possible that the behaviors committed by civilian or military actors which involve the military actually drive levels of polarization and military prestige in the society, and if so, to what degree? I address the potential relationship between political behaviors that involve the military and the levels of polarization and military prestige each in turn. Ultimately, I make two conclusions with respect to concerns over endogeneity. The first is that the degree of concern regarding endogeneity in the theory offered thus far exists at mild and manageable levels. The second is that the greater concern involves the potential impact of political behaviors involving the military on military prestige, rather than the impact on polarization. I briefly trace the logic in arriving at these conclusions in the paragraphs to follow. 

### Do Political Behaviors by the Military Drive Polarization?

I do not strongly suspect that specific acts of political behavior committed by either civilian or military actors that involve the military institution are likely to impact levels of polarization. This may seem surprising at first. After all, one can conceive of a situation in which the military acts in a highly controversial way, such as undertaking a coup, which elicits a strong response from a divided domestic public (for example, some parts of society might favor the coup, while others are opposed to it), and further contributes to the society becoming more divided politically and thus, more polarized.

However, a clear definition of what polarization is (and is not), and a clear operationalization of the concept, shows that such a relationship is unlikely. As I have argued in this chapter with emphasis, polarization is not merely a divided public, although it can certainly manifest itself as such. The heart of the concept of polarization, in my view, focuses instead on the societal division that stems from differences over which worldview(s) and moral values should guide the political community and prevail within the state. Viewed through this lens, at least in the US context, it is highly unlikely that political acts involving the military institution actually cause or generate the division between worldviews or moral values that are prevalent. Rather, it is more likely that the division regarding which worldviews and moral ideologies that various citizens subscribe to and adopt already exists, as these arise from much deeper sources than how a military behaves politically, such as an individual's beliefs about the fundamental purposes of life and the nature of the world. To be clear, I do not contest the notion that instances of political behavior -- by a military, or a government, or other institutions for that matter -- likely serve as a catalyst of sorts for bringing ideological tension within a society to the surface. Indeed, this not only seems plausible, but is almost certainly the case. 

In short, I contend that concerns about endogeneity, at least with respect to the relationship between polarization and political behavior involving the military, can be greatly reduced if these variables are narrowly defined and operationalized. In all instances throughout this dissertation, rising polarization is broadly conceived of escalating tension between the worldviews and moral values that influence, govern, and prevail in society. Instances of the dependent variable, political behaviors that involve the military institution, are also very narrowly and precisely operationalized in the chapters that follow. In the quantitative empirical chapters in particular, instances of the dependent variable are systematically analyzed over time, allowing the researcher to more clearly identify variation and the causes behind it. In this way, endogeneity concerns between polarization and instances of political behavior involving the military are significantly reduced.

### Do Political Behaviors by the Military Drive Military Prestige?

The relationship between military prestige and instances of political behaviors involving the military requires careful examination. The theory presented in this chapter argued that rising military prestige provides civilian and military leaders with an _opportunity_ to engage in political behaviors that violate the principles of civil-military relations. With respect to endogeneity, then, we then must ask to what degree these types of political behaviors influence the prestige of the military.

Admittedly, it is theoretically plausible -- indeed, it is likely -- that certain political behaviors involving the military impact the prestige of the military. To begin with, the relatively high degree of military prestige is in no small way an ostensible consequence of the fact that the US military _does not_ regularly intervene in politics in significant ways. For example, we can rightly suspect that if the US military were to stage a coup and topple the duly elected government, the military's prestige would rapidly fall. In broad terms, then, there appears to be at least a theoretical possibility and likelihood that the relationship between military prestige and instances of political behavior might operate in both directions, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:overview-endog).

```{r overview-endog, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Endogeneity Concerns Regarding the Relationship between Military Prestige and Behaviors that Violate the Central Principles of Civil-Military Relations"}

include_graphics(here("data", "Theory-Endog.drawio.png"))

```

Importantly, however, this is likely not the case for every instance of a political behavior which involves the military institution. As this and the previous chapter made clear, the principle of civilian control of the military can be violated through a number of behaviors that vary in terms of severity and impact [see @croissant_beyond_2010; @brooks_paradoxes_2020; @brooks_crisis_2021; @beliakova_erosion_2021]. As this dissertation focuses squarely on the case of the United States, it examines challenges to the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference that occur via visible but subtle behaviors. For instance, in terms of impact to the principle of civilian control, the behavior of a military officer writing an op-ed is not the same as undertaking a coup. Similarly, it is unlikely that every instance of a military officer giving an interview to the press impacts the broad level of military prestige in the country, unless, of course, a significant number or portion of these interviews violates the principles of civil-military relations that military and civilian leaders are expected to uphold. Careful operationalization of the dependent variable is critical to minimizing concerns about endogeneity. This is upheld throughout the dissertation, I argue, and especially so in the two quantitative empirical chapters. The case studies (Chapters 5 and 6) also help clarify the sequence and order of the overall system of variables that are at play within the theory. 

In addition to specifically defining and operationalizing the dependent variable to the fullest extent possible, the intervening variable in the theory offered thus far significantly aids our understanding of the sequence in which the component parts of the theory work together. The previous chapter and this chapter argued that the levels of polarization and military prestige impact the political behavior undertaken by military and civilian actors by impacting an intervening variable --- the constraining influence of the central principles of civil-military relations. When the constraining influence of the central principles is high, both military and civilian actors generally behave in ways that adhere to the principles, but when the constraining influence is low, these actors behave in ways that violate these principles. With respect to concerns for endogeneity, what is important is that changes in the constraining influence drive actor behavior, and not the other way around, at least at the _individual/micro_ level. In other words, my argument is that actors behave in such a way that violates one or more of the principles of civil-military relations because they are less constrained by these principles, as a result of the motives and opportunities afforded by changing levels of polarization and military prestige. 

At the _group/macro_ level, I fully acknowledge, and indeed would expect -- at least to some degree -- that the converse could be true: one actor's behavior may influence another actor's willingness to abide by the principles of civil-military relations. For example, if a military officer views a superior officer behaving in such a way that violates one or more of the principles of civil-military relations, it is possible that the observing military officer of a lower rank may think that it is appropriate to behave in a similar way, and thus, he or she will feel less constrained to adhere to the foundational principles. But what is being described here, at least in my view, is not so much a concern about endogeneity in the theory, but rather an alternate explanation involving _norm change_. I tackle this very real concern in the section on alternate explanations, below.  

In summary, endogeneity poses a very real concern in this dissertation, especially because this study heavily relies on analyzing observational data, rather than manipulable experimental methods. However, by carefully and clearly defining the independent, intervening, and dependent variables in this study, and by testing for endogeneity in the empirical chapters, concerns regarding endogeneity can be managed.  

### Alternate Explanations

In addition to polarization and military prestige, what other factors could impact the degree to which civilian and military actors commit behaviors that involve the military, and which violate the principles of civil-military relations? Furthermore, how can we test these competing claims? In the paragraphs below, I first identify two alternate explanations. These include the presence of conflict and/or type of threat environment, and norm change. Both of these alternate explanations are plausible in my view, and each offers various ways of testing these alternate claims. 

### Conflict and the Threat Environment

One alternate explanation for civilian and military leaders committing behaviors that challenge the principles of civil-military relations involves the presence of conflict or the overall threat environment. I link the presence of conflict and the threat environment together because of the relationship between these concepts, even though each likely functions differently in terms of impacting the political behavior of military and civilian leadership. It is plausible to think that when there is an ongoing conflict, such as a major war, military leaders are naturally less constrained to adhere to the fundamental principles of civil-military relations. While, to this author's knowledge, there is no formal theory explicating such a concept, one can reasonably see how when the lives of soldiers and troops are at stake, military leaders might be more willing to violate principles of civil-military relations. Indeed, one can argue that this was precisely the case when Colin Powell wrote the opinion pieces that he did in late 1992 and early 1993, just as Bill Clinton won the Presidency and assumed office [see @powell_opinion_1992; @powell_us_1992]. According to this alternate explanation, Powell's behavior stemmed not from partisan ideological differences, but rather differences about the use of force and the subsequent consequences of intervention in a certain way. 

Other scholars have argued that the threat environment directly shapes civil-military relations. For instance, Michael Desch (1999) argues that changes in the international security environment impact the relationship between civilian and military leaders [@desch_civilian_2001]. Desch argues when a nation faces a high external threat and when that country's internal threat is low, such an environment serves as the best possible posture for both sets of actors to maintain the principle of civilian of the control of the military [@desch_civilian_2001, 14]. There is some similarity between the variable of polarization and Desch's variable of internal threat level, but the variables are not exactly the same. Polarization, as I have conceptualized it, speaks much more to the degree of ideological difference that exists in a country, whereas internal threat level speaks more to how the military is postured for domestic use, and importantly, how such a posture impacts its ability to operate abroad [@desch_civilian_2001].

One might also contend here that victory or defeat in war would impact the degree to which military actors in particular shun the principles of civil-military relations. In particular, one can reasonably foresee scenarios in which defeated military officers engage in any number of political behaviors against a political administration that was perceived to have been against the military in some way, similar to some popular narratives regarding the Vietnam War [@mcmaster_dereliction_1997; see also @summers_strategy_1982]. One can also foresee an instance in which victorious military officers, fresh from success on the battlefield, engage in any number of political behaviors that challenge the principles of civil-military relations. These are real concerns. However, I conceive the variable of military prestige as having already captured the effects of defeat and/or victory on the battlefield. In other words, I think it is important to allow for the possibility that either victory or defeat (and many levels in between) can improve or lessen the military's overall prestige. Thus, I do not foresee including defeat or victory in war as an important control variable. 

Given the theoretical expectation that the presence of conflict and/or threat environment can shape the willingness with which the military in particular adheres to the principles of civil-military relations, it is important to control for whether the US is involved in an external conflict where possible throughout the dissertation. This raises additional concerns, however, mainly involving the fact that much of the quantitative data examined in this dissertation is recent, and covers the post-September 11, 2001 era. This could be problematic in that to a certain extent, this era is one in which the US military was continuously deployed, particularly in Iraq and, until recently, Afghanistan. Still, there are various ways to control for the presence of conflict, which I do when appropriate throughout the dissertation. 

### Norm Change

A second type of alternate explanation is one of norm change. This alternate explanation starts from the viewpoint that the principles of civil-military relations themselves -- civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference -- are all behavioral norms that have been constructed by the civilian and military actors over time. This alternate viewpoint, moreover, would explain any sharp change in the political behaviors that defy these norms as a routine process of changing the accepted norms of behavior. Such a viewpoint would emphasize that whereas the accepted norms of behavior used to include binding prohibitions against obvious incursions that violate the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference, these principles are no longer held or deemed as inviolable by the civilian and military actors who practice civil-military relations. Norm change as an alternate explanation is consistent with a rich set of literature within international relations that builds out of the constructivist tradition, and which views various actors such as states [@wendt_anarchy_1992] and organizations [@finnimore_international_1998] who create norms that shape their behavior. 

Norm change stands as a plausible alternate explanation, but it possesses one major flaw that, in my view, renders the likelihood of norm change explaining changing levels in political activity that violate the standards of civil-military relations exceedingly small in the United States. This is particularly true from the perspective of military actors, and less so from that of civilian leaders. 

This flaw is found in the fact that virtually every single official document that aspirationally guides the behavior of military today emphatically states or implies the principles that have been derived thus far in this dissertation. Army Doctrinal Publication 6-22, _Army Leadership and the Profession_, for instance, notes in its first few pages that the Army profession is "a trusted vocation of Soldiers and Army civilians whose collective expertise is the ethical design, generation, support, and application of landpower; serving under Civilian authority; and entrusted to defend the Constitution and the rights and interests of the American people" [@united_states_army_adp_2019, ix]. Similar language emphasizing the principle of civilian control is found in several other places throughout the document [see for instance @united_states_army_adp_2019, 1-6, 1-9 ]. Other documents, such as Department of Defense Directive 1344.10, dated February 19, 2008, prohibit service members from committing certain types of activities that violate the military's non-partisan ethic [@department_of_defense_political_2008]. It is clear that the military as an organization, then, has not reduced its commitment to upholding the central principles of civil-military relations.^[I also make this argument in the historical case studies, particularly in Chapter 5 regarding the post-US Civil War period. To be clear, norms against political involvement by military actors were not as strongly developed in the 1870s as they are today. I address this issue in Chapter 5. Directly comparing military behavior from the 1870s against that in the 1980s might not be a great comparison, but I do argue that the ways in which the independent variables impact the dependent variable operate the same in both periods. For this reason, the historical case studies are not only appropriate, but can greatly round out this study.]  

And yet, I do not deny that perhaps the organization's members no longer feel as bound as they perhaps once were to uphold these central principles. Indeed, a significant aspect of my dissertation is acknowledgement of and explanation for this being the case. Perhaps some military (and civilian) actors commit behaviors simply because they see others engaging in similar behaviors more often. In this way, norm change as an alternate explanation is still plausible. However, because the organization itself is still rather committed to upholding the central principles of civil-military relations, norm change is not likely the major driver of any recent change in levels of political activity. 

## Summary and Way Forward

This chapter developed a theory which argued that the two independent variables of political polarization and military prestige combine to impact the dependent variable --- specific instances, types, and patterns of political behavior involving the military by civilian and military actors. The theory also posited that the independent variables impact the dependent variable through an intervening variable, which is the constraining influence of the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference of the military. 

The theory argued in this chapter holds that high levels of polarization provide a motive for military actors to behave in ways that challenge or violate the standards of civil-military relations [@finer_man_1962]. This occurs, as argued herein, because increasing political polarization reflects disagreement in the populace not only about specific policy matters, but about the moral values and worldviews that should govern society, to what extent, and why. When polarization is high, military actors are increasingly willing to challenge civilian leaders, adopt positions that align with partisan entities and organizations, and advocate for the military to weigh in on or solve problems that are indirectly related to national security and defense. Military actors are increasingly willing to engage in these sorts of behaviors because doing so advances the worldview or moral values held by these actors.  

In addition, it is herein argued that high levels of military prestige provide both military and civilian actors with an opportunity to use the military to influence public opinion [@finer_man_1962]. High levels of military prestige reflect a military that is trusted and respected by the public, and both civilian and military actors are cognizant of this reality. For this reason, holding all else equal, a highly prestigious military has a greater potential of committing or being asked to commit (by civilian leaders) behaviors that violate one or more of the principles of civil-military relations. 

Finally, the theory contends that both polarization and prestige need to be considered in tandem to determine the relative level of political activity that will occur in domestic political environments marked by the presence or absence of high polarization and prestige. When both the motive and opportunity to commit behaviors that violate one or more of the principles of civil-military relations exist, the resulting environment with respect to the conduct of civil-military relations promises to be tense. When neither motive nor opportunity are present, the environment for the conduct of civil-military relations is not perfect but is likely more tranquil. When either a motive or opportunity exist, but not the other, distinctions with respect to the level of overall political activity and which actor commits these activities is less clear. The next four chapters of the dissertation test the predictive power of the theory with intent to sharpen our understanding of each of these four potential domestic environments. 

We now pivot to the first empirical chapter, which examines retired military officer opinion commentary in depth.
