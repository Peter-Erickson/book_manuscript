# Chapter 2 - Theory

This chapter develops a comprehensive theory that explains how and why particular features of a state's domestic environment influence the degree to which the three central principles of civil-military relations effectively constrain the behavior of civilian and military actors. The theory developed in this chapter argues that two variables in particular drive the degree to which civilian and military actors adhere to the central principles of civil-military relations. These variables are political polarization and the prestige of the military. 

This chapter proceeds in four broad sections. The first provides an overview of the theory, defines the components of the theory, and shows how the components of the theory fit together. The second section, the longest of this chapter, derives the variables of polarization and military prestige, and then describes how these variables can work to constrain the behavior of civilian and military actors, but to varying degrees. This second section introduces a simple typology of domestic environments that accounts for both variables present together in a society, and concludes with the presentation of hypotheses to be tested, analyzed, and explored in the remainder of the book. The third section of the chapter examines alternative explanations and addresses endogeneity concerns that exist within the theory. The fourth and final section of the chapter summarizes the theory and then briefly discusses the logic behind the empirical methodology employed in the empirical chapters that follow. 

## Section 1: Overview of the Theory

The core argument of this book is that the two independent variables of political polarization and military prestige together influence an intervening variable --- the constraining influence of the central principles of civil-military relations --- which in turn impacts the dependent variable, the political behaviors that military and civilian actors engage in that involve the military. A visual representation of this theory is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:overview). The political behaviors that civilian and military leaders can engage in involving the military are discussed in detail in the following section, and run the spectrum from overt and obvious on the one hand, to subtle and out of plain sight on the other.

### The Dependent Variable, Political Behaviors Involving the Military

In general, a political behavior involving the military is any action that invokes or harnesses the military for primarily a political purpose, or in a way that results in significant political impacts. Civilian and military actors can and often do engage in different types of these behaviors. But this general definition is not particularly helpful. As those who read Clausewitz know, and as the previous chapter attempted to make clear, militaries always accomplish generic political ends. Indeed, it is difficult to know, both theoretically and practically, where the line between politics and the military should be drawn. 

Towards this end, the three central principles of civil-military relations can help us more precisely define political behaviors that involve the military. The political behaviors that we should be concerned about involving the military are those acts undertaken by civilian or military actors that violate one or more of the following central principles of civil-military relations: civilian control of the military, non-partisanship of the military institution, and military non-interference. Thus, a key question that should be asked about any of the political behaviors that civilian and military leaders engage in that involve the military is whether these acts challenge or violate one or more of the central principles of civil-military relations. 

There are at least two major advantages to developing and employing a framework that measures political behavior involving the military by looking through the lens of adherence to the three central principles of civil-military relations. The first advantage is that there is consensus around these three principles. As the last chapter argued, scholars such as Samuel Huntington as well as his critics share the aspirational ideal of military and civilian actors adhering to the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference of the military. In addition, the previous chapter also argued that there is at least a moderate legal origin for each of the principles. So far, then, so good: those interested in and those who practice the conduct of civil-military relations want to act in such a way so as to _not_ violate one or more of these principles. 

But the second and perhaps greater advantage to instituting the framework here in which the dependent variable examines adherence or violation of these three central principles is that it enables the ability to detect variation (if there is any) in behavior. In so doing, researchers and observers have at least one way --- albeit an imperfect one --- to truly determine whether and the degree to which civilian and military behavior has indeed changed over time with respect to upholding these three central principles. This is an especially important advantage in our current era, in my view, particularly in the United States, where there seems to be much discussion and concern (at least in the late 2010s and early 2020s) in the culture about the military, its role in politics, and whether certain political leaders have overstepped their bounds at times by inappropriately involving the military in politics. The framework offered here enables us to compare behaviors involving the military in one era to another era. Such a comparison can better inform our current situation in important ways. However, we need to better understand more specifically the types of political behaviors that military and civilian actors can engage in that involve the military. The following paragraphs explore such behaviors, beginning with those committed by military actors.

### Political Behaviors Involving the Military that Military Actors Engage in

Previous scholarship has discussed many of the ways in which military actors can and do engage in behavior that involves the military in conspicuously political ways. For instance, Brooks (2009) notes that political behaviors undertaken by military actors are actions that are designed to influence "policy outcomes" or generate "political costs" that a civilian leader must contend with [@brooks_militaries_2009, 213]. Such a definition is consistent with the broad definition above, i.e., any action that invokes or harnesses the military for a primarily political purpose. 

It would be difficult --- perhaps impossible --- to render an exhaustive list of these political behaviors available to military actors. However, we can conceive of these behaviors existing along a theoretical spectrum. At one end of the spectrum are behaviors that tend to be public, obvious, and deliberately intended to influence a distinct policy or partisan outcome. Two such behaviors are acts of "explicit insubordination" by the military and "politicking," a behavior that would include things like endorsing political candidates for office or organizing voting drives [@brooks_militaries_2009, 213]. What is important to note here is that military actors who engage in these particular behaviors are in almost every case, by definition, violating the principle of civilian control (in the case of explicit insubordination) and non-partisanship of the military (in the case of politicking).^[The act of resignation in protest is one behavior that scholars differ with respect to whether such behavior is normatively inappropriate. Many, such as @m_shields_introduction_2017 and @golby_beyond_2015 view the behavior as an overtly political act of defiance and thus normatively wrong for military officers to engage in. Other scholars instead argue that a military officer's moral agency should at least allow for the possibility that resignation is not only appropriate, but a justified and necessary outcome, particularly in response to an immoral order which violates the officer's moral conscience. For such views, see @dubik_principled_2014; @snider_strategic_2014; and @milburn_breaking_2010.] 

At the opposite end of the spectrum are behaviors that tend to be far more subtle --- perhaps not even fully visible to observers --- and which are not always deliberately intended to alter policy of partisan outcomes. Three such behavior types include those of forming alliances with civilian interest groups, lobbying in pursuit of a particular cause, and selectively providing advice or complying with civilian directives.^[Brooks (2009) calls the first two of these behaviors "alliance building" and "shoulder tapping".] It is important to point out that due to both the subtlety of these behaviors, as well as the variety of goals that military actors may seek to achieve by engaging in these behaviors, it is not always clear whether such acts violate one or more of the central principles of civil-military relations. Observers would want to know more about what goal military actors pursued by engaging in behavior such as lobbying and forming alliances, and the full context in which these behaviors occurred. Even then, rendering final judgments about the behavior could prove difficult. 

Consider the hypothetical case of military actors allying with Congressional leaders from both parties in order to pass legislation designed to curb veteran suicide --- a problematic issue that has understandably gained more attention in recent years. On the surface, we would probably conclude that such behavior does not violate any of the three central principles of civil-military relations, and thus is not an example of inappropriate political behavior. But we might conclude otherwise if certain aspects of the context in which this behavior occurred were different. For example, if the military actors in this hypothetical case were primarily forming alliances with Congressional leaders from one political party at the exclusion of another, one could make the case that such behavior is overtly partisan, and thus in violation of the principle of non-partisanship. Or in a different hypothetical case, suppose that military actors only partially complied, or slow-rolled, a legitimate Congressional directive. Such an act would likely be subtle, which might be difficult for observers to prove. One would want to show moderately compelling and defendable evidence that such behavior was deliberately political, and not simply the military giving other tasks --- such as warfighting --- higher priority.^[See @brooks_paradoxes_2020 for a recent example of the military providing selective advice, particularly with respect to how senior US military leaders shaped their advice to civilian leaders regarding the surge to Afghanistan in the early stages of the Obama Administration.] 

Somewhere between the ends of this theoretical spectrum, however, fall a host of other political behaviors that are not subtle, and furthermore, which may or may not violate the principles of civil-military relations, depending on how such behaviors are committed and the greater context in which these behaviors occur. The behavior of a military actor running for office is one such behavior. 

There are at least two factors that need to be examined in the case of a military actor running for office. These include the timing of the candidate's announcement for political office relative to his or her military service, and the degree to which the candidate harnesses his or her record of military service while campaigning for political office. As to the first factor, it would be important to ask whether the military actor declared his or her candidacy for political office after his or her military service was completed, or before. Assuming the military actor did not declare himself or herself for office while serving on active duty, this study's view is that the military actor did not violate the principle of non-partisanship by engaging in such a behavior. The second factor --- the degree to which the military actor harnesses his or her own military service while running for office --- is more complicated. Is it wrong for a political candidate who is also a veteran to showcase one's military service in an attempt to garner votes? Unsatisfactory as the answer may be to some, a fair (but perhaps unsatisfactory) answer is that it depends. For example, long-serving Republican Senator Lindsey Graham appeared in his military uniform after retiring as a Colonel in the US Air Force [@troyan_grahams_2015]. Such an example stands in stark contrast, however, to the case of an active duty military officer actively who campaigned for the US House of Representatives in 2021 while wearing a military uniform [@beynon_army_2021], a case that clearly violated the principle of non-partisanship.  

Another obvious behavior that may or may not violate the central principles of civil-military relations is that of writing opinion commentary (a behavior that is examined in systematic fashion in the following chapter). When General Colin Powell, while serving as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the early 1990s, wrote a series of op-eds in which he articulated his views regarding the use of force, his behavior generated political costs for Bill Clinton --- a political candidate when Powell's first op-ed was published who then became President [@powell_opinion_1992; @powell_us_1992]. Moreover, engagement in this behavior --- by a highly respected and the nation's top military figure --- undoubtedly influenced public opinion, and thus constrained the options available to President Clinton as a number of crises erupted in the Balkans, Somalia, Haiti, and Rwanda. In my own personal view, Powell's actions in this instance violated the principle of civilian control of the military. Yet not every op-ed penned by a military actor criticizes the commander-in-chief's foreign policy. When retired admirals and generals write op-eds about the importance of remembering our nation's fallen on Memorial Day, for instance, they are not creating political costs for the President to contend with. 

Table \@ref(tab:pol-behav) lists and describes several types of political behaviors that military actors may engage in. Several of these behaviors were first theorized by Risa Brooks (2009), but I have built upon her typology by adding several additional types of behaviors and by placing them in a general order of severity [@brooks_militaries_2009, 219]. At the top of the table are those behaviors that clearly violate the principles of civil-military relations. For example, refusing to obey a legal and moral order --- which constitutes an act of "explicit insubordination" --- violates the principle of civilian control _by definition_.  We do not need to know a whole lot more about circumstances (although we certainly should study and learn from them) to determine whether such an act violated one of the central principles. As discussed in this section, behaviors that clearly violate the central principles are explicit acts of insubordination and partisan politicking. 

The table includes six other behaviors which, unlike the top two, are those that _may or not be inappropriately political_, depending on various facets relating to _how_ such behaviors are conducted and the _context_ in which these behaviors occur. The far right column of the table contains several facets that one would want to consider before attempting to render a conclusive determination.

### Political Behaviors Available to Civilians

Like military actors, civilians can also engage in behaviors that harness the military for political purposes. A good definition of political behaviors by civilians that adversely "politicize" the military comes from Jim Golby's (2021) concept of "civilian activation," which he defines as efforts "by civilian political elites to court or co-opt the military for personal, partisan, or electoral gain" [@golby_uncivil-military_2021, 153]. Scholars of comparative politics have long noted the behaviors civilian leaders may engage in that involve the military, particularly for the purposes of consolidating their hold on power. For instance, Quinlivan (1999) articulates a series of "coup proofing" behaviors civilians may undertake in order to prevent military forces from launching a coup, such as establishing "parallel" militaries who hold a "special loyalty" to the regime in power [@quinlivan_coup-proofing_1999]. Similar civilian efforts are described and articulated by De Bruin as "counterbalancing" behaviors [@de_bruin_will_2019]. 

Though such examples are thought to occur primarily in autocratic or weakly democratic regimes, there are nonetheless a host of political behaviors that civilian leaders in mature democracies can undertake that involve the military and which seek to further a leader's political or partisan advantages. However, just as contextual factors were important to consider when examining political behaviors conducted by military actors, so too it is vital --- perhaps even more so --- to examine contextual facets when assessing behaviors committed by civilians that involve the military. For, as Golby notes, "elected political leaders often provide alternative explanations to legitimize or excuse their behavior," and observers cannot readily or easily observe the "intent" of the civilian actors who engage in such behaviors [@golby_uncivil-military_2021, 152].

If we again conceive of the range of possible political behaviors that civilian actors can undertake within mature democracies as a spectrum, we can envision one end consisting of those behaviors committed exclusively for partisan or political advantage. These would include acts such as partisan stacking, which involves Presidents appointing military actors to positions primarily on the basis of shared partisan or ideological alignment, or the act of engaging in a diversionary deployment, which involves Presidents engaging in act of military force at home or abroad in order to divert the public's attention away from some other (usually domestic) political issue or set of issues.^[The act of civilians appointing officers on the basis of shared partisan convictions is one manifestation of what Huntington called "subjective civilian control." See @huntington_soldier_1957, 80-81 for more details.] In both cases, such behaviors would likely violate at least the principle of non-partisanship. By appointing military officers on the basis of partisan or ideological advantage instead of merit, a President has violated the principle of non-partisanship in obvious ways, as partisan alignment has replaced objective qualification standards as the most important criteria for attaining a higher rank or position. And by engaging in a diversionary deployment, a President has violated the principle of non-partisanship because in so doing, the President is likely seeking to reduce the domestic political pressure he or she is facing.^[One such example involves President Donald Trump's deployment of several thousand troops to the US border with Mexico in the fall of 2018 in response to an impending caravan of migrants approaching the US from South America. Some observers saw the move as a type of political move ahead of that year's midterm elections, including several retired Army Colonels who penned an op-ed titled, "Trump's Border Stunt Is a Profound Betrayal of Our Military." See @adams_trumps_2018 for more details. At the same time, others saw the move not as a politically motivated use of the military, but rather as a drastic yet shrewd response to a legitimate crisis that had developed on the US southern border. For such a viewpoint, see @wright_trumps_2018. Whether the move was inappropriately diversionary or properly decisive depends largely on the observer's point of view.] Other behaviors near this end of the spectrum include that of the use of military actors to speak at major partisan gatherings (such as political conventions), or to explicitly endorse or attack political candidates during political campaigns. These instances of electoral swaggering committed by a civilian would almost certainly violate, at a minimum, the principle of military non-partisanship.  

On the other end of the spectrum lie behaviors that likely involve the military for partisan advantage, but in a far more subtle form, and to a far less degree. Suppose, for instance, that a Presidential candidate seeks to garner support for his or her healthcare plan. The candidate asks an elderly military veteran to travel with him or her in order to publicly affirm the candidate's plan, a behavior that would fall under what I call the category of "the military as sales reps". Perhaps such behavior involves the veteran standing up during political town halls and being asked to briefly affirm that the candidate's healthcare plan indeed takes care of the nation's veterans in a satisfactory manner. There is no doubt that such behavior seeks to leverage the military for partisan gain broadly speaking, but in this case, the political candidate is using a much subtler means (an elderly veteran talking about the specific issue of veteran healthcare) than, for instance, employing a prominent military actor at a political convention (a retired general or admiral endorsing the candidate for office). Use of the military as sales reps can take on other forms as well. Some observers, for example, alleged that President George W. Bush's use of General David Petraeus, an immensely popular military figure, to garner Congressional support for the Iraq "surge" strategy in 2007-2008 politicized the military in unhealthy ways [@coll_generals_2008]. Others disagreed on the grounds that the former general, having both the knowledge and experience from having served previously in Iraq, was precisely the right individual to speak to Congress about the new strategy.^[My own point of view in this instance is that while there is room for debate, it was proper and appropriate for General Petraeus to spearhead the collection of Congressional support to help turn around a war that, for the previous several years, had been trending in the wrong direction.] 

Several other political behaviors available to civilian actors may similarly violate one or more principles of civil-military relations, again depending on a number of contextual factors, including how and why each is undertaken. One example is that of "showcasing the Troops," which could include civilian political candidates who, in the course of running for office, feature generic military images and symbols in their campaign ads (a behavior that is explored in detail in chapter four). The common practice of featuring general images of US Troops while patriotic music plays in the background of a political advertisement is likely not problematic. However, if an advertisement instead features images which contain the faces of recognizable senior military leaders in uniform, while the narrator simultaneously states something along the lines of, "Candidate X is trusted by the military to defend the nation," such an advertisement is more problematic, as it directly conveys a partisan connection between the candidate seeking office and the particular military officers shown in the ad.^[In the latter instance, assuming the military officers whose faces were featured in the advertisement were not given a chance to refuse appearing in the ad, the civilian actor (either the candidate or the candidate's campaign team) has committed an inappropriate political behavior.If the officers did agree to appear in the campaign ad, the behavior would still be inappropriate, but the responsibility would be shared between the civilian candidate and the military actors.]

Instances of Presidents visiting and engaging US Troops, either at home or abroad, is another form of showcasing the Troops that can likewise be controversial. These instances may or may not violate principles of civil-military relations. Presidents have long visited military bases to meet and interact with Troops, make major policy announcements, and in the case of visiting service academies in particular, to preside over officer graduation and commissioning ceremonies. President Trump's visit to Iraq in 2018 generated a moderate level of controversy, however, because as some critics alleged, the President's visit had more the look and feel of a partisan campaign stop than that of a Commander in Chief visiting Troops in combat. Indeed, some of the Troops reportedly adorned hats and other "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) gear during the President's visit, which the President happily signed [@fritze_trump_2018]. The President's visit in and of itself was not problematic. However, the way in which some of the Troops appeared to endorse the President in clearly partisan tones _was_ problematic.

Another behavior available to political actors that is both controversial and that may or may not violate the principles of civil-military relations is that of placing "brass in the cabinet." This behavior involves civilian actors who appoint military actors, civilian or retired, to key positions within the government. This behavior is fairly common, and it seems to be gaining momentum. For instance, Presidents George W. Bush, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden all appointed prominent military figures to key civilian billets in their administrations.^[President George W. Bush appointed General (Retired) Colin Powell as his Secretary of State. President Donald Trump appointed a number of active and retired flag officers to positions of prominence, including Army Lieutenant General (Retired) Mike Flynn and later, Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster as his National Security Advisors, Marine Corps General (Retired) James Mattis as Secretary of Defense, and Marine Corps General (Retired) Michael Kelly as White House Chief of Staff. President Joe Biden appointed Army General (Retired) Lloyd Austin as Secretary of Defense.] There is little consensus surrounding at what precise point such behavior becomes problematic, but three factors that should be considered are the relative prevalence of such behavior (which could be measured by examining the percentage of key, top-tier civilian positions filled by retired military officers), the former military rank of those retirees appointed to civilian positions, and the length of time that has passed since the prospective appointee retired from military service. The second and third factors in particular address concerns aimed at the degree to which civilian positions are in fact filled by bona-fide civilians. 

Table \@ref(tab:pol-behav-civ) lists and describes several types of political behaviors that civilian actors may choose to undertake that involve the military. Some behaviors, such as partisan stacking and diversionary deployment, contain clearly partisan currents, while others, as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, involve a far greater degree of subtlety. Unlike in the case of military actors, observers must remember that civilian political actors are to a certain extent inherently partisan creatures, a reality that can complicate rendering decisive judgments regarding instances of behavior that violate principles of civil-military relations. This word of caution is not intended to provide excuses for civilian actors to behave in ways that challenge the norms of democratic civil-military relations, but rather to emphasize for the reader the fact that rendering judgments about civilian actors and the ways in which they behave involving the military could prove more difficult than for military actors.

Together, Tables \@ref(tab:pol-behav) and \@ref(tab:pol-behav-civ) show that there are a variety of behaviors available to military and civilian actors that have the potential to involve the military in politically unhealthy ways. Furthermore, when the three central principles of civil-military relations are in fact the standard by which political behaviors involving the military are assessed, these tables also show that political behaviors exist on relative spectrums, where some types of behavior almost certainly violate one or more principles of civil-military relations, whereas other types of subtle behaviors may not always do so. Finally, the tables illumine some of the contextual factors to consider when attempting to determine whether certain behaviors in fact violate one or more of these central principles. With the dependent variable studied in this book explained and defined, we now shift focus to examining the two independent variables of this study, political polarization and military prestige. 

## Political Polarization

In the academic discipline of political science, polarization generally refers to the movement of thoughts and attitudes within a political community away from the political center and toward more ideological extremes [@hare_polarization_2014; @abramowitz_great_2018]. Pulling on this thread a bit more, we can say that the level of polarization describes the degree to which a political society shares fundamental values, is capable of incorporating divergent worldviews in the political sphere, and the overall degree to which a state's values unite or divide a nation [@marsden_twilight_2014; @deneen_why_2018]. There is always some level of polarization within a community (i.e., there is never no polarization whatsoever). But when polarization operates at relatively high levels, it indicates there is a modicum of discord among the populace that is higher relative to when polarization is low. 

In this book, I rely on a definition of polarization that is consistent with these descriptions, but one that nonetheless includes a much clearer moral, and even a theological, current. More precisely, polarization in this book denotes the degree to which public contestation exists in the political sphere over issues that squarely involve what theologians refer to as the concept of the _image of God_. I contend that where there is political polarization in a community, there is also contestation over how the concept of _the image of God_ should feature in and apply to our politics. Why attempt to include the concept of _the image of God_ in a definition of polarization? Is this really a necessary component of this study, or does attempting to make this connection risk going down a rabbit-hole that will ultimately result in little benefit for a study of civil-military relations? 

At first glance, the concepts of _the image of God_, polarization, and civil-military relations may not seem to be related concepts. It is my claim, however, that this is patently false, and rather, that the concepts of _the image of God_, polarization, and civil-military relations are in fact significantly related. In fact, it is not an overstatement to say that how the citizens of a state conceive of and apply the concept of the _image of God_ in political life is highly determinative of one's political views about a host of issues that impact everyday life. 

This requires presenting a definition of the concept of the _imago Dei_, and then connecting all that this concept entails to politics. Significant scholarship, particularly in the field of theology, has explored the concept in far deeper detail than I am able to present here. Nonetheless, even a summary of the concept of _imago Dei_ will prove vital to the claims that I make regarding the variable of polarization and how it operates. In the section below, I rely primarily on John Kilner's (2015) _Dignity and Destiny: Humanity in the Image of God_ to help summarize what the _image of God_, or the _Imago Dei_ aas it is known in latin,  entails. 

### The Image of God

The concept of the _image of God_ has ancient roots in the Jewish Pentateuch and Christian Bible (to include both the Old and New Testaments).^[John Kilner notes in his landmark text on the image of God that Muslims, in addition to Jewish and Christian peoples, consider the concept of the image of God as "important." See @kilner_dignity_2015, p. 5.]. Over the past millenia, however, it is a concept that even secularists acknowledge has played a tremendous role in the development of our understanding of human rights and and ethics [@kilner_dignity_2015, 5]. So vital has the concept of the _image of God_ been that, as T.B. Maston notes, "it is doubtful if there is any one concept more basic for Western Civilization and Democracy in general" [Maston quoted in @kilner_dignity_2015, 4].   

In the Jewish and Christian texts, the _image of God_ first appears in the book of Genesis, the first book of both the Pentateuch and the Bible and which tells the story of God's creation of the Earth. In the first chapter of Genesis, we read in verses 26-27 that, "Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.' So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them." According to the book of Genesis, then, it is God himself who not only made the very first man and woman --- whose names were Adam and Eve --- but who made them _in His own image_. The _image of God_ appears in many other parts of the Bible, including in the New Testament in Colossians 1:15, 2 Corinthians 4:4, and James 3:9. Because the exact meaning of the concept of _the image of God_ is not defined explicitly in any one of these passages, scholars such as Kilner conduct careful biblical exegesis to arrive at a conception of what it means for mankind to be made in God's image. 

Kilner concludes that _the image of God_ boils down to two important and related aspects. The first is that all of mankind has a "special connection" to God [@kilner_dignity_2015, 116]. Because mankind enjoys this special connection with the very God who made them, all men and women are endowed with a tremendous sense of "God-given dignity" that cannot be lessened [@kilner_dignity_2015, 133]. On this point in particular, Kilner stands in contradistinction with many previous religious leaders throughout history who, as Kilner points out, interpreted humanity's creation _in the image of God_ as the ways in which humans currently embody particular attributes that are unique to humans (unlike animals or trees or any other created object) [@kilner_dignity_2015]. These attributes have generally included the ability to reason, the ability to behave righteously, and the ability to rule well [@kilner_dignity_2015, 17-19].^[Many other theologians have emphasized this point about how people are different from animals because of their ability to take moral responsibility and to exercise rationality. For instance, see @grudem_systematic_1994, 445-449.] 

Kilner has significant issues with this view, however. Though Kilner agrees that humans were in fact created to be different from animals, Kilner charges that once the _image of God_ is conceived of as emphasizing attributes that are currently present in people, the door is open to undo the very foundation that the _image of God_ intends to uphold. That is, "when people assume that being in God's image is about ways that people are presently like God, they are disposed to read into God's image whatever traits or capacities their contemporary culture admires" [@kilner_dignity_2015, 49]. Kilner argues that this has led to remarkable abuses that have been justified using _image of God_ language, including the holocaust, slavery, and denying women full civil rights [@kilner_dignity_2015, 20-31].  

The second aspect of the concept of _the image of God_ is the idea that mankind is intended to "reflect" God --- that is, to become like Him in unique and important ways [@kilner_dignity_2015, 116-133]. Kilner further argues that even though all people are incredibly damaged by the effects of sin in the world, humanity remains "intimately connected with God because God's image is the very blueprint for humanity" [@kilner_dignity_2015, 92]. That is, because humanity is made in God's image, all men and women are endowed with a purpose as they live out their lives on the earth, and that purpose is to "to exercise benevolent rule in this world as God's representative and under his authority" [@vandrunen_politics_2020, 59]. To be sure, we will all do this to variable degrees, and in different places and historical contexts. But reflecting and increasingly becoming more like _God's image_ is the design for men and women, according to Kilner. Kilner supports this notion especially by appealing to to New Testament passages such as Colossians 1:15, which claims that it is God's Son, Jesus Christ, who is _the image_ of God (as opposed to mankind, which is made _in the image_ or _according to the image_ of God) [@kilner_dignity_2015, 72-82]. 

There is nothing wrong with _the image_ of God --- that is, with Christ. The problem is sin in the world, because it temporarily prevents mankind from fully actualizing all that God intends them to become. However, because of Christ and what He accomplished in living a sinless life, dying on the cross for the sins of the world, and being raised again (points that are central to the Christian faith), then there is a very real "destiny" for those who trust in Christ, a destiny that is "primarily about God's eternal purposes for humanity" [@kilner_dignity_2015, 274]. This "destiny" will occur slowly, argues Kilner --- "in appropriate measure, to God's glory" [@kilner_dignity_2015, 281].

Careful integration of these two aspects --- a shared connection between all people and God, and a destiny that God is moving humanity towards --- carries important implications for how mankind ought to live with one another. First, because of our shared connection, all people share a tremendous sense of the "dignity, sacredness, equality, and unity" that comes from being in God's image, and thus, all people should treat each other with dignity and respect on this basis [@kilner_dignity_2015, 316]. Second, because there is a destiny for mankind that belongs to the God who made them, people should act in such a way that recognizes that the center of the universe is not themselves, but God. This is an especially important point, because it implies that there is in fact a moral order to the universe, an order that is entirely congruent with the God who created all things.^[The entire field of natural law, for instance, is built upon and works off of this assertion.] Failure to recognize a moral order is bound to failure because people will inevitably attempt to elevate their own rights over those of others. For Kilner, any discussion about rights should thus be "closely tied to a clear sense of the dignity/sacredness of all people. Otherwise, rights claims can degenerate into mere assertion of self with no regard for others" [@kilner_dignity_2015, 318].^[In this way, Kilner's work on the _image of God_ carries a similar strain of thought to recent critiques of America's political system of liberalism, which some have claimed has led to both political parties emphasizing individual rights in extreme but divergent ways. See @deneen_why_2018 for one such work.] 

We can conclude this summary of Kilner's work on _the image of God_ by stating that for those who subscribe to this concept, it should cause us to ask two important questions as we live our lives out in the political sphere. The first is, are the policies that I am advocating for consistent with treating people with dignity and respect, and second, are the policies that I am advocating for morally right? Indeed, for those who take the concept of the image of God seriously, they cannot easily divorce this concept from their politics, nor from any part of their life. Indeed, the concept of the image of God "has profound implications for our conduct toward others" [@grudem_systematic_1994, 450]. It is not an overstatement to claim that how one thinks about the concept of the _image of God_ impacts how one answers perhaps life's most important questions, including: what is a human being, what does it mean to treat everyone with dignity and respect, what does it mean to be created male and female, what obligations do I owe my fellow human beings, and what is the purpose of my existence.

### Connecting Polarization and the Image of God in Politics

These are not new questions, but my claim is that there is heightened disagreement over how to answer these questions when polarization is high. To see this, I will present in this section several political and cultural features of the contemporary United States. I begin with exploring how our polarizing political moments are thought of and explained by political scientists, most of whom, so far as I know, do not explicitly invoke the concept of the _image of God_ when explaining polarization. I then examine other observations of contemporary American culture made by several theologians and cultural critics. When these observations and critiques are examined, they fortify my argument: heightened political polarization occurs when significant contestation exists in the political sphere over issues that squarely involve the _image of God_. For clarity in my argument, I am not suggesting that there can be or that there has been a time when there will be no disagreement about how the _image of God_ should be applied to our politics.  Such an assertion is naive. What I am suggesting, though, is that political issues tend to generate heightened controversy when these issues inherently relate to the treatment of others with dignity and respect and the implementation of morally correct policy than when they do not. When these types of issues are increasingly contested in our politics, the result is heightened polarization. 

Contemporary polarization in the US can be described as a relative erosion of cohesion brought about by profound differences in the way people see the type of country that America should be and what it should stand for. Political scientists who specialize in the study of polarization note that the level of polarization has increased in recent years. But it is not so easy to diagnose why this has been the case. Allen Abramowitz, one of the world's leading experts on polarization, explains the causes of America's contemporary polarizing politics as "fundamentally, a disagreement over the dramatic changes that have transformed American society and culture since the end of World War Two, and that continue to have huge effects in the twenty-first century" [@abramowitz_great_2018, x]. Sides, Tesler, and Vavreck (2018) argue similarly that the US has undergone profound changes over the past several decades, and specifically describe the 2016 Presidential Election --- in which Donald Trump defeated the heavily favored Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton --- as "symptomatic of a broader American identity crisis," and that "issues like immigration, racial discrimination, and the integration of Muslims boil down to competing visions of American identity and inclusiveness" [@sides_identity_2018, 10].  

Scholars also note that there are at least three features of today's polarized environment in America. The first is that polarization goes far beyond political differences harbored between political elites. Indeed, average and everyday citizens who identify as Democrats simply dislike those who identify as Republicans, and vice versa, at greater levels than previously seen. This phenomenon has been coined "affective polarization" [@iyengar_affect_2012; @iyengar_origins_2019; @abramowitz_great_2018]. A second feature of today's polarizing environment is the increasing scope of the partisan battleground. This refers to the fact that politicians and citizens do not disagree and wage political war merely over a handful of important issues, but rather over what seems like everything. Scholars have called this dynamic "conflict extension" [@layman_party_2002; @layman_activists_2010]. A third feature of politics in the US today is the seemingly all-encompassing nature of identity politics. As any contemporary observer can attest to, group identities and political interests are heavily bound up together in issues concerning the topics of race, gender, religion, immigration, and more [@white_values_2002; @mann_its_2012; @sides_identity_2018]. 

Scholarship outside of the field of political science notes similar characteristics of America's polarized society. Carl Trueman, a church historian and cultural commentator, argues that many of the modern political debates and issues in the West today --- especially those that involve issues of sexuality, such as the entire LGBTQ+ movement --- are not so much the problems that _cause_ political polarization, but rather the _symptoms_ of a massive change that has occurred over the past decades --- even centuries --- involving how society views the notions of selfhood and identity. Whereas individuals in previous societies generally accepted that the individual was not the center of the universe but rather part of a transcendent and sacred order, Truman argues that the modern self is ultra-focused on seeking pleasure, expressing one's self, and bucking historical notions of authority [@trueman_rise_2020].^[This gradual but significant change has occurred, Truman argues, as various intellectual traditions such as Nietzche, Marx, Freud, Marcuse, and others have supplanted the more-traditional and sacred origins of identity in our modern societies. There has been a gradual rejection of the acceptance of the concept of the image of God by western societies with respect to key ways in which people live.] In fact, Truman asserts that the quintessential contemporary issue that signifies the rejection of the sacred order is the transgender rights movement. Underneath the many questions that have roiled many parts of the country over the past several years on the topic of transgender rights, including whether a person can or should be able to change their gender, whether doctors should be allowed to provide gender-affirming care [@sapsford_us_2023], whether people should have to use bathrooms that correspond to their sex at birth [@kusisto_transgender_2022], and whether there should be strict rules for who can compete on male and female sport teams, is a far "deeper rejection...of any and every sacred order" because a person is categorically rejecting one of the deepest of ways that he or she has been created [@trueman_rise_2020, 381]. 

We can more clearly understand polarization to involve contestation over issues that involve application of the concept of the image of God when we see that that even among those who hold religious beliefs, there seems to be little consensus and instead, significant division, about how to apply the image of God appropriately to particular political issues. This strongly suggests that those who are interested in the proper application of the image of God feel strongly about the particular issue or set of issues in question, which makes further sense when we see many of these issues as involving moral aspects. Aaron Renn (2022) notes that in less than 30 years (since 1994), American society has changed such that Christian morals and principles have gone from being seen as a generally positive thing to one in which they are now "expressly repudiated and seen as a threat to the public good and the new public moral order" [@renn_three_2022]. This is a significant development in modern America, but there is even more to this story, as Renn notes. Indeed, Renn posits that since 2014 (the Obergefell Supreme Court decision that legalized gay marriage, to be exact), there has been a culture war "within evangelicalism itself" concerning how to function in a society where Christianity is no longer regarded positively [@renn_three_2022]. The scholarly observations from both political scientists and cultural theologians are distinct, but point in a very similar direction: contemporary polarization in the US is clearly associated with issues that are rife with significant moral currents and themes. 

The issue of abortion in contemporary US politics continues to show this reality in perhaps the clearest of ways, as abortion is a longstanding political issue that deals with multiple facets of the image of God: what is a human life, when does a life begin, and who or what can terminate such a life, for what reasons, and how do we account in a response about the life and welfare of the mother? In the US, it seems as though one political party predominantly fights to preserve a woman's right to have an abortion, so much so that in recent years, some Democrats have advocated for abortions to be performed as late into a pregnancy as possible. Another political party has fought hard to curb abortion significantly, with few exceptions. Republicans rejoiced across the board when, in 2022, the Supreme Court, fresh with three justices appointed by Donald Trump, voted to overturn _Roe v. Wade_, the decision that since 1973, guaranteed a woman's right to choose. At the risk of truncating what is a complex and divisive political topic, the important point I wish to make here is that that common ground is unlikely to be found on such an issue, particularly when each side pursues vastly different objectives. Too much is at stake for those on both sides of the political aisle. Those who are against abortion routinely argue that life begins at conception, that all human beings are created by God, and therefore that only God can choose when to begin and end a life. Those who favor abortion often frame it as a woman's right to choose, and thus find the arguments made by those who are pro-life as unconvincing.

The military has been impacted by these political debates in a variety of ways, even as many of its leaders wish to remain outside of politics. Table \@ref(tab:imago-dei-issues) captures several contemporary political topics in the United States. For each political issue, several acute questions exist that indicate how citizens feel towards a certain issue. For each issue, the table also captures at least one instance of how the military has been impacted by the political issue. Finally, the table distills how each political issue relates to the concept of the image of God.

### Polarization and the Image of God in the US Over Time

This section orients the reader to the measurement of polarization over time. In political science, one of the benchmark measurements of polarization in the United States has been that of dynamically-weighted, three-step estimation scores (DW-NOMINATE). These are derived from examining roll call voting patterns among members of each Congress [@jeffrey_b_lewis_voteview_2020]. Figure \@ref(fig:polar-chamber) shows polarization levels present in the US House and Senate since the latter portions of the 19th Century, when the Republican Party became mainstream [@hare_polarization_2014; @jeffrey_b_lewis_voteview_2020]. As Figure \@ref(fig:polar-chamber) demonstrates, polarization levels in the United States were very high around 1880, and remained high before gradually decreasing early in the 20th century. The figure further shows that polarization reached its nadir in the years before World War Two, then remained at relatively low levels until approximately the mid-1970s. Since that time, however, polarization in both chambers of the US Congress has increased steadily, to the point that contemporary levels now exceed those previously recorded.

The fact that polarization existed at an extremely high level after the end of the Civil War is consistent with the notion that polarization rises when the political issues that are at stake generate contestation regarding the concept of the _image of God_ and its application. Slavery and the resulting quest to secure civil rights for African Americans, including the US Civil War, were both issues that directly involved the image of God in significant of ways. Even Abraham Lincoln the Presidential Candidate, who was hardly an abolitionist, invoked the image of God implicitly when forming his thoughts on how to debate Stephen Douglas, his Illinois political opponent, in the early 1850s. Lincoln scholar Allan Guelzo states that Lincoln appealed to "the morality of natural law, even of natural theology", to counter Douglas's stance on the doctrine of "popular sovereignty" as slavery threatened to spread into the territories of Kansas and Nebraska [@guelzo_abraham_2010, 188]. Lincoln believed that black people were of infinite more worth than mere property, and thus, that those who favored the expansion of slavery on the grounds that slaves constituted property "in the same sense that hogs and horses are" were deeply mistaken [Abraham Lincoln cited in @guelzo_abraham_2010, 190].

Polarization has been measured in a second way in the American politics literature. First derived by Iyengar et al. (2012), measurements of "affective polarization" or "negative partisanship" have been derived by using data from the American National Elections Studies (ANES) [@iyengar_affect_2012]. Beginning in the late 1970s, the ANES has asked a series of "feeling thermometer" questions, in which respondents are asked to provide, on a scale ranging from 0-100, how they feel about a range of topics, including their feelings about political parties. Figure \@ref(fig:affect-polar) graphs the results of how partisans feel about members of their own party, members who affiliate with the opposite party, the difference between these two answers, and a total level of affective polarization, which is the sum of the difference for each of the two main parties in the United States. As Figure \@ref(fig:affect-polar) shows, measurements of how favorable each party is have remained more or less constant over the past several decades. However, partisans have increasingly rated those on the opposite side of the political spectrum as increasingly less favorable over the same time period. In other words, data shows that partisans do not necessarily like the party with whom they affiliate more, but rather that they disdain those on the other side of the aisle at greater levels.

### Summary - Why Polarization Matters

One does not have to look hard today at American politics to notice that the current level of polarization in America is indeed very high. Indeed, it is little wonder that both candidates running for President of the United States in 2020 claimed that the very "soul of the nation" was at stake [@dias_biden_2020]. Like anyone else, members of the US military are not immune from holding strong views and opinions on central questions that involve the concept of the _image of God_. These types of questions and issues tend to invoke deeply moral and often theological commitments. Thus, when central and consequential issues and concerns are at stake that relate to the _image of God_, members of the military and civilian actors will increasingly behave in a way that advances the values and worldviews that they believe in, even if doing so runs counter to the central principles of civil-military relations. I unpack this claim more in depth later in the chapter, but now turn to the second independent variable contained in the theory.  

## Military Prestige 

The second independent variable examined in this study is military prestige. In defining prestige, I follow the sociological literature regarding the stratification of professional occupations and professions. This literature denotes two components that comprise the variable of prestige [@davis_conceptual_1942; @jaco_prestige_1970]. The first component deals with how important an occupation or profession is in terms of its positional role in society, or what Davis (1942) calls, "the invidious value attached to any given status or office" [@davis_conceptual_1942, 312]. This component of military prestige thus has in mind the relative _importance_ or _centrality_ of the military with respect to the function it serves and the roles and tasks it carries out. We might anticipate that the importance or centrality of the military varies as a result of factors such as the threat environment. For example, a society that lives under the constant threat of attack by another nation, and whose military is constantly working to ensure that these threats are defeated, may view its military as more central to the state than another society that rarely faces significant threats. 

The second component of prestige examines society's evaluation of the _performance_ or _excellence_ of an occupation or profession, or the manner in which its members "[carry] out the requirements of [their] position" [Linton, 1936 as cited in @davis_conceptual_1942, 312]. Applying this to the prestige of the military, this second component of prestige thus deals with the degree to which society deems the military is skilled. We might say that this component of prestige involves the degree to which the military meets society's expectations, or is judged to be competent by society.^[This second component of military prestige is probably most similar to "public confidence" in the military, a variable that is explored in great detail by Peter Feaver in @feaver_thanks_2023. In this book, particularly in the empirical chapters, I rely on a measure of public confidence in the US military to serve as a proxy for military prestige] For example, if a state's military is victorious in battle, one might expect that state society's evaluation of the skill of its military to increase. Similarly, the presence of significant scandals might result in a relative decrease in a society's evaluation of the skill, or excellence, of its military.^[Feaver (2023) found some proof, in fact, for these specific causal pathways using experimental data, though he cautions that the actual effects may be lessened once partisanship is accounted for. See @feaver_thanks_2023, 91-118.]

The distinction of these two components of military prestige matters insofar as that theoretically, the two components may operate at different levels simultaneously. It is possible, for instance, for a military to be viewed as highly central or important, but nonetheless not very skilled, or conversely, for a military to be relatively unimportant to society, yet rather skilled at the tasks society expects it to perform. Furthermore, it follows that changes to the overall level of military prestige may be driven by one or both of the components described above. For example, the US military victory during the Gulf War likely did not primarily alter the centrality of the military in terms of the centrality of the function it provided the United States. The military had, well before the Gulf War, occupied a central role --- defending the nation --- throughout the Cold War period. But the victory in the Gulf War did change how Americans perceived the military's overall skill and professionalism. When President George H.W. Bush proclaimed, in 1991, that "It's a proud day for America. And, by God, we've kicked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all," his comments pointed to the fact that the US military had shed any lingering perceptions or doubts regarding its abilities, dating back to the end of the Vietnam War [@bush_george_1991].^[Senior military leaders who participated in the Gulf War likewise viewed that victory as the signature expression of an Army that had, in the two decades after Vietnam, rebuilt itself. See @kitfield_prodigal_1997.] 

The following section briefly traces the contemporary US military's high level of prestige through each of the two components described above. With respect to the military's centrality to the nation, the following section argues that for a majority of the post-World War Two era, the US military has played a central role in helping to craft and implement American foreign policy. With respect to society's perception of the military's professional excellence, the section then describes how society's level of public trust in the military has changed over the past several decades.

### The Centrality of the Military Institution

Over the past seventy-five years, the United States instituted a series of significant bureaucratic reforms that firmly cemented the military as a central player in American foreign policy by expanding the military's scope and influence within the government. The first of these significant reforms occurred after World War Two, when President Truman signed The National Security Act of 1947 in order to unify the defense and intelligence establishments. Despite emerging victorious in Europe and in the Pacific, World War Two had proven that the American military services did not always work well together [@kaiser_no_2014]. On several occasions, they had proven to be parochial and self-interested, traits that were less than helpful in a resource-constrained environment, such as war. 

The National Security Act sought to make the military establishment more effective and more efficient. It created new institutions such as the National Security Council (NSC), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the US Air Force [@noauthor_national_1947], and more formally, merged the Departments of War and Navy into the "National Military Establishment," which essentially served as the precursor to what became the Department of Defense in 1949 [@locher_has_2001]. These reforms were not only reflective of the central role that the nation's military would play in international affairs in the years to come, but they also proved to be quite successful.^[So influential was the National Security Act that fifty years after its signing, President Bill Clinton stated that as a result of the institutions created by the National Security Act and the people who had served in them, a generation had "helped to secure the peace and prosperity that America enjoys...the success of their efforts and of the historic legislation enacted half a century ago is reflected in an outstanding record of achievement: nuclear war averted, the Cold War won, and the nations of the world turning to democracy and free markets." See @clinton_weekly_1997 for more details.] 

The military underwent a second set of institutional defense reforms known as the Goldwater-Nichols Act in the 1980s. Named after Senator Barry Goldwater and Congressman William "Bill" Nichols, several incidents occurred in the early 1980s that exposed deficiencies in the way the US military conducted operations. For starters, the failed Iranian hostage rescue in 1980 demonstrated that the separate military services were unable to operate in an integrated, or joint, environment [@kitfield_prodigal_1997]. The ultimate goal of the Goldwater-Nichols Act was to ensure that in an age in which military technologies and equipment were becoming increasingly sophisticated, American national defense interests would be identified and prioritized over and above the parochial organizational interests of the individual and separate military services [@locher_has_2001]. 

Importantly, among the most significant of the changes wrought by the Goldwater-Nichols Act was codification of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as the President's principal military adviser, a change which meant that all advice from the respective individual service chiefs of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps would flow through the new Chairman [@locher_has_2001; @wills_effect_2016]. Also important, the Goldwater-Nichols Act created several regional combatant commanders, each of whom would report directly to the Secretary of Defense [@locher_has_2001; @wills_effect_2016]. In essence, the Goldwater-Nichols act institutionalized both the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combatant Commanders as incredibly powerful military positions --- positions that remain very powerful today.  

A further source of the contemporary military's importance to the nation involves the widening scope of responsibility the military has assumed, especially in the post-9/11 era. Although the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq each involved a sizable civilian component for at least a portion of the wars, the military nonetheless assumed control for a significant portion of the day-to-day decision making of these conflicts, even over issues that once were, at least ostensibly, primarily civilian responsibilities.^[The topic of the interaction (or lack thereof) of military and civilian efforts during the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts has become a burgeoning literature that includes a mixture of official government reports, autobiographical memoirs, and works that offer other theoretical and historical insights. For a sample of this literature, see @iraq_study_group_us_iraq_2006; @ricks_fiasco_2006; @chandrasekaran_imperial_2007; @hodge_armed_2011; @chandrasekaran_little_2013; @gallagher_day_2019.] So central has the military become as a result of the legislative changes wrought over the past several decades, combined with nearly two decades of overseas experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, that one scholar has argued that in essence the Pentagon has replaced the State Department as the government's "organizational center of gravity for U.S. national security and foreign policy" [@schmidt_silent_2019].^[Another scholar states that the US military's institutional influence has become so powerful that asking for "Pentagon 'help' is like being hugged by an eight-hundred-pound gorilla: it can squeeze the life right out of civilian efforts." See @brooks_how_2016, 91 for more details] 

Finally, an important indicator of centrality within the government is the size of the military budget compared to other government departments. Figure \@ref(fig:dodstate-budgets) displays each department's total budget in 2016 real dollars between 1962-2016. The graph clearly hints at the idea that the Defense Department has taken on a growing role relative to the State Department over the past several decades. The resulting inference is that the Department of Defense continues to be a very large player in shaping American foreign policy.^[In the empirical chapters of the book, the predominant measures of military prestige rely on measurements of public trust and confidence in the military, as reported through various public opinion polling. The relative size of the DoD versus State Department Budget could also be used, but these budgetary differences likely also reflect institutional developments, such as the advent of the All-Volunteer Force, which is very expensive to maintain. For this reason, public opinion measurements of trust and confidence in the military are better (though still imperfect) measures of the military's overall level of prestige, and are used throughout the book.]

```

### The Military's Skill & Expertise

The second factor comprising the military's high level of prestige involves society's perceptions of the military's skill or excellence. There are few direct measurements of this component specifically, but a closely-related measurement is the degree of public trust --- or confidence --- that Americans place in the military.^[The definitive work on public confidence and the US Military is @feaver_thanks_2023. One of the key findings in the book, which relies on novel survey data taken in the 2019-2020 period, is that there appear to be several broad factors that influence public confidence in the military, including performance, professional ethics, partisanship, and peer pressure. But, because the book relies on survey data, Feaver notes that it is not possible to state if these factors are responsible for changes over time in the levels of public confidence in the military.  See @feaver_thanks_2023, p.90 for more details.]

```

```

While recent polls show that trust in the military may in fact be slipping [@mcintyre_people_2021], the fact is that relative to other institutions, Americans still seem to respect their military considerably. According to recent Gallup public opinion polls, 72 percent of Americans indicate that they trust the military a "great deal" or "quite a lot" -- the most of any institution, to include Congress (13%), the Presidency (39%), the police (48%), the Supreme Court (40%), and the church/organized religion (42%) [@noauthor_confidence_2020]. Moreover, trends in trust of various American institutions over time reveal that, whereas trust in the military has generally increased over the past 45 years, trust in the other institutions has generally declined or remained the same. These trends are displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:insttrust).^[Again, here the insights of Feaver (2023) are incredibly helpful. His work points us to _why_ Americans tend to trust their military. Among these insights, he finds that the following beliefs tend to result in increasing levels of trust and confidence placed in the military:  belief that the military is competent, shares the values of citizens, is not too partisan, is truthful, and is ethical. See @feaver_thanks_2023, 85-90.]

This section has focused on the institutional military. But it is important to at least allow for the variable of military prestige to operate along an individual level, too. Indeed, history shows that military leaders can and often do become widely popular, particularly if they earn fame and renown on the battlefield (corresponds to the seconding dimension of the variable of military prestige, skill/excellence) or if they are serving in important roles (corresponds to the first dimension of the variable of military prestige, centrality). Generals George Washington, Ulysses S. Grant, Douglas MacArthur, Dwight Eisenhower, and David Petraeus are all such figures. In this book, I argue that when the prestige of the military is high, civilian and military actors possess a greater opportunity to use the military in ways to leverage public opinion relative to when military prestige is low. Furthermore, when military prestige is high, I argue that civilian and military actors may be less inclined to act in ways that adhere to and are consistent with the fundamental principles of civil-military relations.

## Section 2 :How Polarization and Prestige Impact the Constraining Influence of the Central Principles of Civil-Military Relations
\doublespace

Having defined both the dependent and independent variables in this chapter, and having defined the central principles of civil-military relations in the previous chapter, we can now blend these elements into a cohesive theory. First, I argue that high levels of political polarization provide a _motive_ for military leaders to engage in political behaviors that challenge the central principles of civil-military relations. Then, I argue that a high level of military prestige provides _both_ military and civilian leaders with an _opportunity_ to do the same  [@finer_man_1962]. Finally, I argue that the combination of relative levels of polarization and military prestige lead to the formulation of four distinct domestic political environments in which civil-military relations occur.

\singlespace
### Polarization - A "Motive" to Challenge the Principles of Civil-Military Relations
\doublespace

Increasing polarization serves as a _motive_ for military actors to behave in ways that violate the central principles of civil-military relations. This occurs because high polarization denotes there is division within a society regarding how the concept of the image of God should be applied to political issues that are often moral in nature. Highly polarized climates signify not merely political differences within a community, but, especially at extreme levels, incompatibility regarding the underlying moral values and worldviews that seek to shape society. Thus, as polarization rises, military actors increasingly encounter situations in which they must make judgments about whether to abide by the fundamental principles of civil-military relations, or to engage in acts of behavior that, although violating the central governing principles of civil-military relations, are nonetheless congruent with a particular set of values that these military actors support. The extreme example of this in US history occurred on the eve of the Civil War, when, of the 1,080 officers on the rolls of the active officer corps, 286 (26.5%) resigned [@murray_civil_2012, 9]. This act of resignation for the purposes of taking up arms against the Army in which one had just served is perhaps the epitome of a behavior that violates the principles of civil-military relations. And yet each who chose to resign had to weigh the decision to resign against other factors, including where he stood with respect to the issue of slavery, an issue with significant ramifications regarding the image of God.      

Military officers are taught to eschew politics, but doing so is more difficult the more that politics involves moral issues, which as this chapter has argued, are more likely to surface during periods of relatively high polarization. Military officers are part of the American society that they serve. Before they join the military, military officers are young men and women who grow up somewhere. Like the rest of American society as a whole, military actors collectively become polarized as different worldviews and ideologies compete for supremacy in the political square. Furthermore, after joining the military, each military officer further develops his or her own worldview, and relies on certain moral values to help guide his or her behavior. When worldviews are increasingly at odds with each other to the point that they become incompatible --- which is the case when contestation is present over issues that squarely involve the image of God, as I argued earlier in this chapter --- military officers will encounter greater friction as they execute their routine duties. 

This friction has at least two sources. First, highly polarized environments increase the frequency with which military officers encounter situations in which they have to choose between supporting and obeying their civilian leaders or following the dictates of their own moral conscience. Rising polarization, in other words, ultimately leads to a problem of authority, and specifically, who or what is the highest authority that military officers will obey. Second, highly polarized environments increase the magnitude of the disparity that exists in these choices because the difference in outcomes (e.g., obeying and supporting a civilian leader or following one's conscience) is more likely to involve not merely a minor difference in political opinions, but a difference in worldviews, moral values, and the purposes that seek to influence American society. We can see both of these sources by examining those who resigned from the US Army on the eve of the Civil War and later joined the Confederate States Army. First, while these officers may have held views that were favorable towards slavery in some cases for many years prior to resigning, the issue of slavery and its extension became more pronounced and thus, more urgent, in the 1850s. Second, those who ultimately resigned likely eventually came to the realization at some point that there could be no middle ground. The choice they faced was to stay in the US Army and to take up arms against slavery and their home states, or to not (and for many, to instead join the ranks of the Confederate States Army). Indeed, the perceived difference in outcomes of this choice was significant. 

Thus, as polarization rises, some military officers will be willing to violate the principle of civilian control when they deem that the preferred policies held and promulgated by a particular civilian leader or administration are not simply politically unwise, but wrong in a moral sense. If rising polarization reflects differences about what moral values and worldviews are to govern the nation and society, then the definition of which orders or policies are immoral will increasingly depend on the worldview and moral values held by a particular military officer relative to those espoused and promulgated by a civilian leader.^[Furthermore, military doctrine regarding officership and ethics has long noted the immense role of morality in guiding the behavior and conduct of military officers. For example, Army Doctrinal Publication 6-22, entitled, _Leadership and the Profession_, states that, "The Army ethic has its origins in the philosophical heritage, theological and cultural traditions, and the historical legacy that frame our nation." See @united_states_army_adp_2019, 1-7, for more details.] 

In a similar vein, some military officers may be willing to violate the principle of non-partisanship if they believe that one of the major political parties possesses an agenda that is not simply wiser from a political perspective than the other party, but rather one which aligns to the moral views of the officer on a particular issue or set of issues. Finally, some military officers might be motivated to violate a standard of "non-interference" of the military into certain areas of state policy if they believe that the military should play a greater role in advancing the underlying ideology or values associated with a particular issue or set of issues.  

### Example - The Military and Race in Contemporary America

Among the clearest contemporary examples of polarization providing a "motive" for military actors to engage in political behaviors which violate the principles of civil-military relations is the issue of race in America. For any observer or participant of American politics over the past several years, it comes as no surprise that the issue of race has become one of the most polarizing political issues in the United States.^[In many ways, and as the first case study describes, this is not an entirely new issue. The military has played a central role within issues that pertain to race, including desegregation of the Armed Forces.] The military, along with many other institutions, such as primary education, corporate America and business, and religious establishments such as the church, has been thrust into discussions involving race in America and what to do about it.  
At the risk of summarizing what is a topic that deserves a much fuller and lengthier treatment than can be given here, I will attempt to capture why the military and the issue of race have collided so drastically over the past few years, and to show how they have done so. In articulating this example, my aim is to demonstrate how the issue of race has served as a _motive_ for some military officers to engage in behaviors that violate, or at least challenge, the principles of civil-military relations. Furthermore, the key to understanding why this has been the case is in understanding that the events and discussions that have made race in America such a visible issue over the past several years have ignited different worldviews, values, and ideologies among military officers (like the nation itself) on the topic of race.  

Recent Pew Research public opinion data (2021) reveals just how split Americans are over the issue of race and what to do about it. Of Americans surveyed in July of 2021, 49% said that "a little" (34%) or "nothing at all" (15%) needs to be done "to ensure equal rights for all Americans regardless of their racial or ethnic background" [@pew_research_center_deep_2021]. In the same survey, however, 50% of those said that "a lot" needs to be done to advance the same [@pew_research_center_deep_2021]. Moreover, among the 50% who believe that "a lot" needs to be done to ensure equal rights for all, respondents were split with respect to whether current systems could accommodate the changes that needed to be made, or whether "most US laws/institutions need to be completely rebuilt" [@pew_research_center_deep_2021]. 

It is difficult to find any place, organization, or work space today that is not somehow impacted by discussions revolving around race. The military is no exception, and strong opinions abound whether these developments and the approaches that have been implemented to achieve racial harmony actually harm or help. What cannot be denied is that beliefs and convictions on the issue of race increasingly compel behavior that aligns with one's view on this topic (and other polarizing topics). For instance, in the wake of the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, 2020, multiple high ranking military officers penned opinion pieces that, while directly addressing President Trump's handling of protests across the United States, also more broadly revealed their own perspectives on race in the United States [@brooks_let_2020]. For example, Retired Admiral Mike Mullen, a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, penned an article in _The Atlantic_ shortly after these events occurred entitled, "I Cannot Remain Silent," in which he blasted President Trump's reported use of the National Guard to clear a path through Lafayette Square in order for the President to walk to nearby St. John's Church for a photo.^[In June of 2021, interestingly, the Inspector General of the US Department of the Interior issued a report in which he did not and could not corroborate any finding suggesting that Trump had given the order to use US Capitol Police to clear the park, and that the plan to clear the park had been in place for hours before Trump's walk from the Rose Garden to the church. See @montanaro_watchdog_2021 for more details.] In the article, however, Mullen further stated, "We must, as citizens, address head-on the issue of police brutality and sustained injustices against the African American community" [@mullen_i_2020]. 

This last sentence is clear evidence of Mullen's worldview, and it explains, at least in part, why he was willing to write an opinion piece that strongly and directly criticized a sitting President. The title itself, "I Cannot Remain Silent," describes how Mullen prioritized his worldview and his personal values over adhering to the principle of civilian control of the military, which likely would have resulted in either not writing the piece to begin with, or at least couching the piece in softer language that did not directly criticize the former President. To be clear, my aim here is neither to claim that Mullen was wrong for writing the piece, nor that he was right to do so, but rather to suggest that at a minimum, Mullen's personal decision to write the piece and to criticize the former President in the process flowed directly from his personal worldview regarding race in the United States and what should be done about it. 

The topic of race in America is likely to remain a motive for military officers to behave in ways that violate principles of civil-military relations for some time. More than a year after the death of George Floyd and the aftermath that followed, race in America remains a visibly hot topic, even in the military. Indeed, more than a year after Mullen's publication, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, appeared before Congress to answer questions regarding the military and its supposed stance on _Critical Race Theory_ (CRT). Critical Race Theory is something that most Americans had never heard of before 2020, but in recent months, debates about what Critical Race Theory is, and whether and how it should be implemented and applied in American institutions, have been extensive.^[I do not have the space to unpack CRT, or _Critical Theory_ in general, in this book, nor is that my goal. What is interesting, however, is the extent to which multiple institutions of nearly every flavor are debating, criticizing, or commenting on CRT. For example, evangelical churches are sharply divided over whether Critical Theory is even compatible with their religious doctrines. See, for instance, @allen_why_2020 and @baucham_fault_2021 and two evangelical leaders who offer strong warnings against the church adopting views on social justice that are compatible with _Critical Theory._ See also  @belkin_mask_2021 for an example of the role of CRT in school board battles ahead of the Virginia Gubernatorial Election, an election that many contemporary political observers interpreted as a resounding defeat of progressive education policies that aggressively implemented CRT. See also @saunders_behind_2021 for a confirmatory view, but also @saletan_what_2021 for a more nuanced view.] During the hearing, General Milley greatly angered Republican Members of Congress when he essentially stated that the military does not teach CRT, but that it remains a topic that should be learned and read about so as to better educate American military officers [@kurtzleben_joint_2021].

The bottom line is that the issue of race in America may serve as a motive for some military actors to engage in behaviors that challenge the governing standards of civil-military relations, depending on where a particular military officer stands with respect to the issue of race in America. Those who strongly believe that the lack of relative proportional minority representation among senior general and flag officers and among key occupations such as fighter pilots constitutes proof of a pernicious form of racism that still exists are more likely to behave in ways that affirm such a view. Other military actors who believe that the presence of these dynamics are the result of other underlying factors, such as selection of certain types of military roles that are correlated with race and socioeconomic background, are more likely to behave in ways that affirm these viewpoints [see, for instance, @dinick_race_2021]. 

Debates over these differing ideologies, worldviews, and things like CRT are not likely to remain merely philosophical or ethereal debates for members of the military. Indeed, differences over these particular issues impact how the military functions and operates. Consider the military's promotion system, and how different worldviews and ideologies lead different people to institute various policies. In June of 2020, Trump's Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, announced that the Department of Defense would remove all photographs of personnel as they are considered for promotion, in order "to ensure promotion boards and selection processes enable equal opportunity for all service members, promote diversity in our ranks, and are free from bias on race, ethnicity, gender, or national origin" [Mark Esper quoted in @schogol_dod_2020]. Such a policy is likely to please those who disagree with the assertions and goals of CRT, and who would affirm a _colorblind_ approach to combat racism. At the same time, such a policy is inherently against the assertions of proponents and advocates of CRT. Just a year later, some leaders in the Navy and Marine Corps announced that removing the photographs from promotion boards has hindered the Navy from achieving its goals with respect to diversity, and therefore, that the photos should be reinstated. For instance, Vice Admiral John Newell remarked at a panel on the topic of diversity in 2021, "I think we should consider reinstating photos in selection boards...we can show you where, as you look at diversity, it went down with photos removed" [Newell quoted in @toropin_navys_2021]. 

This example serves as just one timely and relevant example of how different ideologies can impact, and have impacted, the behavior of various military actors as their personal worldviews and moral values are thrust into the political spotlight.^[There are many examples of how different views regarding race have generated friction within the US military. One example involves a letter penned to the leaders of the United States Military Academy by several recent graduates alleging the systemic racism of West Point; see @askew_anti-racist_2020 for the original letter and more details. How one interprets this letter is largely a function of one's belief about the issue of race in the United States. See @dreher_wokeness_2020 for a right-of-center analysis of this letter and its implications.] The example of Admiral Mullen as a retired senior military officer blatantly criticizing a sitting US President shows how polarizing environments can lead to military officers behaving in ways that support the worldview, ideology, and moral values that they hold to, even as such behavior also violates one or more of the principles of civil-military relations. 

Does increasing polarization mean that civilian actors will also increasingly violate the central principles of civil-military relations? In my view, no, it does not. The main reason for this is that rising polarization by itself does not automatically denote that civilians will seek to employ the military in necessarily controversial ways, or in the pursuit of partisan ends related to highly polarizing issues. To be clear, there are numerous historical instances in which the military finds itself at or near the center of polarizing and controversial political issues. For example, the military played a major role during Reconstruction at the end of the Civil War, and the military has played a sizable role in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in modern times, which has certainly been a bitter and polarizing issue across the United States. These are both examples of the military finding itself at or near highly polarizing issues, in which case, I think it is reasonable to suspect that civilian actors might increasingly violate central principles of civil-military relations. But the military is not at the center of every polarizing topic. 

Pew Research Center polling conducted in 2020, for instance, found that among the most polarizing topics in the US today are climate change, gun control, the environment, and immigration [@pew_research_center_environmental_2020]. Other public opinion research has found that issues such as abortion are now more polarizing in the US than they have been in several decades [@blazina_key_2021]. The theory I have offered thus far affirms that members of the military, like the public, are strongly divided over all of these listed issue areas. But it is not necessarily the case that civilian leaders will use the military, directly or indirectly, to achieve their desired policy goals in each of these areas. For example, of those described above, only immigration and to a lesser degree, climate change, have directly intersected with the military. This is not to say that future gun control and environmental policies do not and will not impact the military, but rather that to date, these issues have not induced significant military action or involvement.^[Furthermore, one does not have to imagine scenarios that are too far flung to ascertain that significant civil-military strife could follow if the military were to be used in a greater way over any number of polarizing issues. Hypothetically, if a future President were to order active-duty forces to secure abortion clinics within the United States, there would likely be significant tension, if not between the President and military leaders, then at least among political parties and press outlets.] Thus, rising polarization weakens the constraining influence of the central principles of civil-military relations for military actors, but not necessarily for civilian actors.

### Prestige - An "Opportunity" to Challenge the Principles of Civil-Military Relations
\doublespace

Rising military prestige, on the other hand, offers an _opportunity_ for both civilian and military actors to engage in behaviors that violate the central principles of civil-military relations. This stems from the connection between rising prestige and its perceived influence on the _potential_ to impact public opinion. Note that for purposes of this theory, rising military prestige need only increase the _potential_ of the military to impact public opinion, not necessarily the _efficacy_ to actually do so.^[Scholarship has examined whether using the military, or specific military actors, actually can sway the public. The results are not conclusive. See @golby_military_2012 and @golby_listening_2013 for two such studies.]  

A significant amount of scholarship in the subject area of political communication describes how, why, and the extent to which elites can influence public opinion [for a sampling of this scholarship, see @saunders_no_2017; @guisinger_mapping_2017; @baum_relationships_2008; and @kertzer_bottom-up_2017]. Scholars differ on the degree to which elites actually impact public opinion; nonetheless, the literature shows that in general, the public looks to elites who are "knowledgeable" and "trustworthy" when thinking about which public voices to listen to [@lupia_democratic_1998, 69-76]. Scholars also claim that the more elites are perceived by the public to hold the attribute of credibility (broadly speaking), the greater capacity these elites have to "cue" public opinion [@zaller_nature_1992, 47].

Viewed through the lens of varying levels of military prestige, we can now project this scholarship onto the ability of trusted military elites (and perhaps the military institution in general) to impact public opinion. It is reasonable to consider that the more prestigious a military becomes, the more that military leaders will be considered to be "knowledgeable and trustworthy" [@lupia_democratic_1998, 69-76]. This is especially true if we conceptualize the second component of military prestige, its perceived level of skill or excellence, as the degree of public trust placed in the military (which I have argued, earlier in this chapter, is at least a reasonable proxy for military prestige). Thus, during periods in which military prestige is high, both civilian and military actors have an _opportunity_ to use the military to attempt to influence public opinion. 

We may certainly expect that civilian actors will be responsive to rising levels of military prestige. After all, a primary motivation of political actors is to remain in office [@strom_behavioral_1990]. Furthermore, previous scholarship extensively shows that leader credibility, in any number of domestic and international contexts, is important [@saunders_no_2017]. Thus, if and when civilian actors believe that engaging in behaviors that harness a prestigious military will improve their electoral chances, these civilians are more likely to engage in these behaviors, even if they violate one or more of the principles of civil-military relations in the process. 

There is also ample reason to suspect that military actors --- not just civilians --- are also responsive to rising levels of military prestige. If military actors know that they are increasingly valued, trusted, and esteemed by society, they may be more likely to behave in ways that violate one or more of the principles of civil-military relations. This could be because highly esteemed military actors believe that the public who values them will overlook or forgive such infractions, or because they, conscious that they are viewed as a highly trusted and respected voice in the nation, believe they have an increasing duty to act as the saviors or guardians of the country [@finer_man_1962; @fitch_armed_1998, 129; see also @schmidt_silent_2023]. Regardless of the reasons for which it occurs, higher military prestige results in a greater likelihood that military actors may behave in ways that challenge the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference of the military. 

At first glance, the fact that civilians are responsive to high levels of military prestige seems to fit several instances in US history. Indeed, popular military figures have influenced public opinion in significant ways and in a variety of different periods. Generals Ulysses S. Grant and Dwight D. Eisenhower, for instance, were both wartime commanders who, largely as a result of the popularity they commanded with the public for an extended period of time in uniform, ultimately ascended to the Presidency [@teigen_why_2018]. 

In summary, high levels of military prestige present an _opportunity_ for civilian and military actors to use the military as an instrument to impact public opinion. This can result in both civilian and military actors engaging in behaviors that violate the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference of the military institution. These behaviors, as the examples listed below illustrate, can take a variety of forms.  

### Examples - Colin Powell Opinion Commentary and Retired Officers Speaking at Political Conventions

Instances of civilian and military actors using the military during periods of high military prestige to sway public opinion abound in US history. In the paragraphs below, I give two examples, both of which are intended to illustrate how a high degree of military prestige -- either at the personal or institutional level -- provides an _opportunity_ for both military and civilian actors to engage in political behaviors that violate the central principles of civil-military relations. 

The first involves the well-known instance of General Colin Powell who, as the sitting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in late 1992 - early 1993, wrote two opinion pieces in popular press outlets as Bill Clinton assumed the presidency. These pieces essentially challenged Bill Clinton's views regarding the use of military force and what could be achieved in the Balkans, where a very serious war had started in the wake of the dissolution of Yugoslavia [@powell_opinion_1992; @powell_us_1992]. The timing of these pieces was also critically important. Powell's editorial in the _New York Times_ was written just weeks before Election Day in 1992, while Clinton was still campaigning, and Powell's _Foreign Affairs_ piece was published later that winter, right as Bill Clinton assumed the presidency itself. Perhaps Powell cleared the content of both pieces with the Bush Administration, which was still in charge when these opinion pieces were likely submitted for consideration. 

But what is important from the perspective of the three central principles of civil-military relations is that even if Powell did allow the Bush administration to review the content of his articles, Powell at a very minimum knew that airing his views in a public manner would generate political costs for Clinton, if elected President. This is because the content of Powell's opinion pieces contradicted many foreign policy views held by Clinton and members of his cabinet. For instance, Powell's _New York Times_ editorial entitled, "Why Generals Get Nervous," explicitly stated that, "In Bosnia, there are no clear military goals," [@powell_opinion_1992] and his piece in _Foreign Affairs_ stated that a potential mission of sending US military forces lacked "clear and unambiguous objectives" [@powell_us_1992, 38]. 

Powell's opinions clashed not only with Clinton's, but also with those held by many of his deputies, including  Madeline Albright, Clinton's Ambassador to the United Nations and later, Secretary of State. Albright felt more optimistic about the goals that American military forces could achieve in the Balkans and in other trouble spots around the world. In a 2006 interview, Albright recalled the way in which Powell would frame military choices in rather stark terms for Clinton's foreign policy team. Albright recalls that, "On a regular basis Colin would come in and do a presentation...he’d go through this and say, 'We can take that hill and we can do that and we can do this. You know we have the best military in the world, but it’s going to take 500,000 men and $500 billion and 50 years.' So he’d lead you up the hill of possibilities and then drop you off the other side, and you’d end up with no options" [@albright_william_2006]. 

By the mid-1990s, Powell was no longer Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but by appealing to the American public through opinion commentary as Clinton came into office and by framing military options in excessively black and white terms for the new administration, Powell not only likely steered public opinion against the possibility of American military intervention in Bosnia, at least initially, but he also likely made the option increasingly unappealing to policymakers behind closed doors. Regardless of the wisdom of Powell's advice, I contend that his actions also violated the fundamental principle of civilian control of the military in that it did not allow the Commander in Chief to genuinely consider and weigh a full range of possible policy options with which to respond to multiple developing crises in the world after the end of the Cold War. 

And while we cannot be certain what drove Powell to write the two opinion pieces when he chose to write them, it is reasonable to conclude that Powell's actions were facilitated --- at least in part --- by the enormous degree of personal clout and prestige he carried. Powell was a charismatic, well spoken, educated, and likable figure who had become increasingly well known in the wake of the US victory over Iraq in the Gulf War. Powell likely believed that by engaging in the public behaviors that he did, a significant portion of the public would not only agree with his stance on military intervention in Bosnia, but be willing to either overlook or forgive any perceived breach of protocol insofar as military figures eschewing the political spotlight. In this way, Powell's high personal prestige afforded him an _opportunity_ to behave in the way that he did. 

A second and different example involves Army Lieutenant General Mike Flynn and Marine Corps General John Allen, each of whom, as retired officers, spoke at the respective Republican and Democratic Conventions in 2016. Regardless of what they said at the convention (Flynn is known for leading chants of "lock her up," referring to the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton), the act of speaking at an event that is inherently partisan violated the principle of non-partisanship of the military. In the aftermath of these conventions, Retired Army General Martin Dempsey, who had recently served as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, published an opinion-editorial piece in _The Washington Post_ in which he criticized both the retired officers and the candidates who had asked them to speak. Dempsey argued in his op-ed, "As generals, they have an obligation to uphold our apolitical traditions. They have just made the task of their successors –- who continue to serve in uniform and are accountable for our security -- more complicated. It was a mistake for them to participate as they did. _It was a mistake for our presidential candidates to ask them to do so_" [@dempsey_military_2016, emphasis mine; see also @exum_dangerous_2017]. 

In this example, the military institution's relatively high prestige likely provided an _opportunity_ for Flynn, Allen, and the civilian leaders who asked each of these generals to speak to violate the principle of military non-partisanship. Neither Flynn nor Allen were household names at the time, and it is doubtful that most Americans could identify either general's photograph today. It is more likely the case that each of the political candidates and their campaign organizers sought a military general's public endorsement because each believed that having a high ranking military voice would prove politically advantageous. Furthermore, both officers who agreed to speak also likely did so, at least in part, because each officer believed that he could influence public opinion and ultimately advance the political prospects of each candidate proceeding to the presidency. I am not suggesting that the high level of polarization that prevailed in 2016 was also not a factor in the officer agreeing to speak; indeed, the theory I have offered would instead affirm that high polarization played a large role in shaping and contributing to each officer's behavior. Rather, I am pointing out that first, it is highly unlikely that either general would have been asked to speak in the first place at either of these conventions had the military as an institution not commanded relatively high prestige at the time of the party conventions in 2016; and second, that each officer likely agreed to speak _at least in part_ because he believed he could impact public opinion, at least to some degree, because the institution with which each officer was primarily affiliated -- the military -- was highly prestigious.

### Polarization and Prestige Generate Four Types of Domestic Structures
\doublespace

If high levels of polarization signify that military leaders possess a _motive_ to intervene in politics, and if high levels of military prestige afford both civilian and military leaders an _opportunity_ to use the military to engage in political behaviors, it follows that four broad types of domestic political structures exist that denote varying adherence to the fundamental principles of civil-military relations. These four structures are displayed in Table \@ref(tab:poss-environment). Given the presence or absence of _motives_ and _opportunities_, the simple typology below captures variation in each quadrant along two primary axes: the predominant type of actor inducing politicization by committing political behaviors (military or civilian) that violate the principles of civil-military relations, and the overall level (low, moderate, or high) of these acts. The final evaluation made in each quadrant stems from the combination of the axes, and offers a prediction for the overall potential for civil-military conflict (low, moderate, or significant) that exists under the domestic political conditions found in each quadrant. 

```{r poss-environment, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}

text_env <- tribble(~"Environment", ~"Low Polarization", ~"High Polarization",
  "Low Prestige", "No politicization; low levels of political activity; low potential for civil-military conflict", 
  "Military (induced) politicization; moderate levels of political activity; moderate potential for civil-military conflict",  
  "High Prestige", "Military and Civilian (induced) politicization; moderate levels of political activity; moderate potential for civil-military conflict", 
  "Comprehensive politicization; high levels of political activity; high potential for civil-military conflict" 
  )

### Low Polarization, Low Military Prestige

In this environment, military actors lack an ideological _motive_ to intervene in politics in ways that involve the military, and both civilian and military actors lack an _opportunity_ to harness the military in ways that seek to leverage public opinion. This leads to the theoretical expectation that while there might certainly be conflict between military and civilian leaders in this type of domestic environment, such conflict will likely not be widespread nor comprised of highly visible and public acts. Political behaviors involving the military do occur in this environment, but they do not generate significant civil-military tension. Historical examples in the United States of this domestic structure include the post-Vietnam (roughly 1973-1990) and immediate pre-World War Two (roughly 1936-1944) eras.

### High Polarization, Low Military Prestige

When polarization is high but military prestige is low, military actors possess a _motive_ to engage in political behaviors that threaten or violate the central principles of civil-military relations. However, as a result of the low level of military prestige that exists in this type of domestic structure, civilian and military actors lack the _opportunity_ to use the military in ways that leverage public opinion. This leads to the theoretical expectation that in this environment, military actors in particular might engage in political behaviors involving the military, but that civilian actors are unlikely to induce political behavior involving the military. Furthermore, the overall level of political activity that occurs in such an environment accords with moderate potential for civil-military conflict. A historical example of this era includes the years between the end of American Reconstruction and the start of the Spanish American War (roughly 1877 - 1898).

### Low Polarization, High Military Prestige

In a domestic structure where polarization is low, but military prestige is high, military actors lack an ideological _motive_ to conduct behaviors that involve the military politically. However, because military prestige is high, both civilian and military actors possess an _opportunity_ to use the military to leverage public opinion. This leads to the theoretical expectation that under these conditions, both actor types are likely to engage in visible political behaviors involving the military institution. However, the potential for civil-military conflict is only moderate, because even though both sets of actors might seek to employ the military to shape public opinion, there is not as significant a level of contestation in the political sphere over political issues as a result of a low level of polarization. 

Broad examples of this period include portions of the post-World War Two era until the end of the Vietnam War (roughly 1945-1973) and the post-Gulf War period (roughly 1991-2009). Several historical civil-military relations crises occurred under these conditions, including a major dispute between between President Truman and General Douglas MacArthur in 1951, another between General Matthew Ridgeway and President Eisenhower over the role of nuclear weapons and American's "New Look" policy, and yet another between President Bill Clinton and General Colin Powell in the early 1990s. 

### High Polarization, High Military Prestige

When polarization and military prestige are both high, military actors possess a _motive_ to intervene politically, _and_ both military and civilian actors possess an _opportunity_ to involve the military in ways that are intended to leverage public opinion. Under these conditions, military actors are increasingly willing to behave in ways that violate the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference. Furthermore, both military and civilian actors have an _opportunity_ to use the military to appeal to the public. This leads to the theoretical expectation that both actor types, military and civilian, will engage in highly visible political behaviors that challenge the principles of civil-military relations. Furthermore, because polarization is high, such an environment is likely to include contestation over political issues that involve the application of the image of God, signifying that military actors in particular are more willing to press against and potentially violate the principles of civil-military relations out of a desire to act in a way that accords with their particular moral stance. Accordingly, there is high potential for civil-military conflict in this domestic structure. 

Examples of this period include the immediate post-US Civil War period during the start of American Reconstruction (roughly 1865-1868) as well as in the modern era (roughly 2010-2021). These conditions are also associated with a number of recent and historical civil-military relations disputes, including between President Andrew Johnson, General Ulysses S. Grant, and Congress for control of the military as an institution in the early years of American Reconstruction, and recent tension between the military under the leadership of President's Trump and Biden in the present day. 

Based on the theoretical predictions that follow from Table \@ref(tab:poss-environment), it is possible to derive the following five hypotheses, which will be tested in the remainder of the book: 

H1: Military actors increasingly violate the central principles of civil-military relations when polarization is high relative to periods of low polarization. 

H2: Military actors increasingly violate the central principles of civil-military relations in public and visible ways when military prestige is high relative to periods of low military prestige. 

H3: Civilian actors increasingly violate the central principles of civil-military relations when military prestige is high relative to periods of low military prestige. 

H4: Military and civilian actors engage in relatively more visible and public forms of political behavior that involve the military institution when military prestige is high relative to periods of low military prestige. 

H5: The most extreme levels of overall political activity occur in environments that are characterized by simultaneously high levels of political polarization and military prestige.  

## Section 3: Endogeneity and Alternate Explanations

This section highlights the extent to which endogeneity poses a concern for the theory offered thus far. This section also addresses several alternate explanations. As King, Keohane, and Verba (1994) note, endogeneity is a "common and serious problem" in the social sciences, especially in non-experimental settings [@king_designing_1994]. As this book relies entirely on observational and historical methods, rather than experimental methods, endogeneity poses a genuine concern that must be both acknowledged and dealt with. Endogeneity essentially involves the "direction" of causality, or how the variables that comprise a theory work in a sequence [@king_designing_1994]. While there are many different types of endogeneity, all forms generate concerns that the relationship between a particular set of independent variables and a dependent variable is not, in reality, what the researcher concludes it is [see Chapter 11 of @gerring_social_2012 for a description of different types of trouble that endogeneity poses]. 

Applying concerns about endogeneity to the theory that has been offered thus far in this chapter involves asking whether it is possible that instead of the levels of polarization and military prestige driving the political behaviors committed by civilian and military actors that challenge the principles of civil-military relations, which I have argued, is it possible that the behaviors committed by civilian or military actors which involve the military actually drive levels of polarization and military prestige in the society, and if so, to what degree? I address the potential relationship between political behaviors that involve the military and the levels of polarization and military prestige each in turn. Ultimately, I make two conclusions with respect to concerns over endogeneity. The first is that the degree of concern regarding endogeneity in the theory offered thus far exists at mild and manageable levels. The second is that the greater concern involves the potential impact of political behaviors involving the military on military prestige, rather than the impact on polarization. I briefly trace the logic in arriving at these conclusions in the paragraphs to follow. 

### Do Political Behaviors by the Military Drive Polarization?

I do not strongly suspect that specific acts of political behavior committed by either civilian or military actors that involve the military institution are likely to impact levels of polarization. This may seem surprising at first. After all, one can conceive of a situation in which the military acts in a highly controversial way, such as undertaking a coup, which elicits a strong response from a divided domestic public (for example, some parts of society might favor the coup, while others are opposed to it), further contributing to a society becoming more polarized.

However, a clear definition of what polarization is (and is not), and a clear operationalization of the concept, shows that such a relationship is unlikely. As I have argued in this chapter with emphasis, polarization does not merely point to a public that is divided, although it certainly manifests itself as such. Polarization points to something much deeper, that is, it indicates societal division stemming from contestation over issues that involve the _image of God_, and how the concept of the _image of God_ should be applied in the political space. Viewed through this lens, it is highly unlikely that political behaviors involving the military institution exacerbate division in the moral worldviews or moral values that citizens hold. It is far more likely, rather, that such divisions would be pre-existing, but that political behaviors conducted by the military draw these pre-existing fissures out in a more noticeable way.^[This argument is congruent with that of @deneen_why_2018 and @trueman_rise_2020, both of whom state, albeit in different ways, that the discord present in American society and culture today is not the cause of our polarized politics, but rather the symptoms of far-deeper problems.] In short, concerns about endogeneity (with respect to the relationship between polarization and political behavior involving the military) can be managed if the variables used are operationalized and defined as precisely as possible. Care has been taken throughout the book to do just that, although I do not pretend that it has been done so perfectly. 

### Do Political Behaviors by the Military Drive Military Prestige?

The relationship between military prestige and instances of political behaviors involving the military requires a more careful examination, however. The theory presented in this chapter argued that rising military prestige provides civilian and military leaders with an _opportunity_ to engage in political behaviors that violate the principles of civil-military relations. With respect to endogeneity, then, we then must ask to what degree these types of political behaviors influence the prestige of the military.

Admittedly, it is theoretically plausible -- indeed, it is likely -- that certain political behaviors involving the military impact the prestige of the military. To begin with, the relatively high degree of military prestige is in no small way an ostensible consequence of the fact that the US military _does not_ regularly intervene in politics in significant ways. For example, we can rightly suspect that if the US military were to stage a coup and topple the duly elected government, the military's prestige would rapidly fall. Although not the same as conducting a coup, Feaver (2023) found that confidence in the military fell when citizens were made aware of the military acting in an unethical manner [@feaver_thanks_2023, 103-108, 267]. In broad terms, then, there appears to be moderate evidence, as well as a theoretical plausibility, that the relationship between military prestige and instances of political behavior might operate in both directions, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:overview-endog).

```

Importantly, however, this is likely not the case for every instance of a political behavior which involves the military institution. As this and the previous chapter made clear, the principle of civilian control of the military can be violated through a number of behaviors that vary in terms of severity and impact [see @croissant_beyond_2010; @brooks_paradoxes_2020; @brooks_crisis_2021; @beliakova_erosion_2021]. As this book focuses squarely on the case of the United States, it examines challenges to the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference that occur via visible but subtle behaviors. For instance, in terms of impact to the principle of civilian control, the behavior of a military officer writing an op-ed is not the same as undertaking a coup. Similarly, it is unlikely that every instance of a military officer giving an interview to the press impacts the broad level of military prestige in the country, unless, of course, a significant number or portion of these interviews violates the principles of civil-military relations that military and civilian leaders are expected to uphold. Careful operationalization of the dependent variable is critical to minimizing concerns about endogeneity. This is upheld throughout the book, I argue, and especially so in the two quantitative empirical chapters. The case studies (Chapters 5 and 6) also help clarify the sequence and order of the overall system of variables that are at play within the theory. 

In addition to specifically defining and operationalizing the dependent variable to the fullest extent possible, the intervening variable in the theory offered thus far significantly aids our understanding of the sequence in which the component parts of the theory work together. The previous chapter and this chapter argued that the levels of polarization and military prestige impact the degree to which the central principles of civil-military relations effectively constrain civilian and military actor behavior. When the constraining influence of the central principles is high, both military and civilian actors generally behave in ways that adhere to the principles, but when the constraining influence is low, these actors behave in ways that violate these principles. With respect to concerns for endogeneity, what is important to note is that the theory suggests that changes in the constraining influence drive actor behavior, and not the other way around. Actors violate one or more of the principles of civil-military relations because they are less constrained by the central principles, as a result of the motives and opportunities afforded by changing levels of polarization and military prestige. 
I readily admit that to a moderate degree, the converse could also be true, but with an important caveat. Indeed, an actor's behavior that violates the central principles of civil-military relations likely indicates a weakening of the intervening variable, the constraining influence of the central principles of civil-military relations. The caveat here, however, is that at some point, it becomes difficult to disentangle the order of events. Does a behavior that violates the central principles of civil-military relations _indicate_, or _result in_, a lessening of the constraining influence of the central principles? This is an important question, especially when we consider the possibility of norm change as an alternate explanation, and specifically, whether civilian and military actors are more willing to engage in behavior that violates principles of civil-military relations because such behavior is simply occurring more often. 

I concede here that we have to be aware of both possibilities, that a weakening influence of central principles results in actor behavior that violates the central principles (as I have offered), as well as that the behaviors that violate central principles further weaken the constraining influence of the central principles of civil-military relations. Real though this risk is, it is important point to remember that as the theory has argued, norms and principles do not just weaken spontaneously. Even if norms change (and they do), we need to ask why they change, and the explanation offered in this book serves as one such starting point. In summary, endogeneity poses a very real concern in this book, especially because this study heavily relies on analyzing observational data, rather than manipulable experimental methods. However, by carefully and clearly defining the independent, intervening, and dependent variables in this study, and by testing for endogeneity in the empirical chapters, concerns regarding endogeneity can be managed.  

### Alternate Explanations

In addition to polarization and military prestige, what other factors could impact the degree to which civilian and military actors commit behaviors that involve the military, and which violate the principles of civil-military relations? Furthermore, how can we test these competing claims? In the paragraphs below, I first identify two alternate explanations. These include the presence of conflict and/or type of threat environment, and norm change. Both of these alternate explanations are plausible in my view, and each offers various ways of testing these alternate claims. 

### Conflict and the Threat Environment

One alternate explanation for civilian and military leaders committing behaviors that challenge the principles of civil-military relations involves the presence of conflict or the overall threat environment. I link the presence of conflict and the threat environment together because of the relationship between these concepts, even though each likely functions differently in terms of impacting the political behavior of military and civilian leadership. It is plausible to think that when there is an ongoing conflict, such as a major war, military leaders are naturally less constrained to adhere to the fundamental principles of civil-military relations. While, to this author's knowledge, there is no formal theory explicating such a concept, one can reasonably see how when the lives of soldiers and troops are at stake, military leaders might be more willing to violate principles of civil-military relations. Indeed, one can argue that this was precisely the case when Colin Powell wrote the opinion pieces that he did in late 1992 and early 1993, just as Bill Clinton won the Presidency and assumed office [see @powell_opinion_1992; @powell_us_1992]. According to this alternate explanation, Powell's behavior stemmed not from partisan ideological differences, but rather differences about the use of force and the subsequent consequences of intervention in a certain way. 

Other scholars have argued that the threat environment directly shapes civil-military relations. For instance, Michael Desch (1999) argues that changes in the international security environment impact the relationship between civilian and military leaders [@desch_civilian_2001]. Desch argues when a nation faces a high external threat and when that country's internal threat is low, such an environment serves as the best possible posture for both sets of actors to maintain the principle of civilian of the control of the military [@desch_civilian_2001, 14]. There is some similarity between the variable of polarization and Desch's variable of internal threat level, but the variables are not exactly the same. Polarization, as I have conceptualized it, speaks much more to the degree of ideological difference that exists in a country, whereas internal threat level speaks more to how the military is postured for domestic use, and importantly, how such a posture impacts its ability to operate abroad [@desch_civilian_2001].

One might also contend here that victory or defeat in war would impact the degree to which military actors in particular shun the principles of civil-military relations. In particular, one can reasonably foresee scenarios in which defeated military officers engage in any number of political behaviors against a political administration that was perceived to have been against the military in some way, similar to some popular narratives regarding the Vietnam War [@mcmaster_dereliction_1997; see also @summers_strategy_1982]. One can also foresee an instance in which victorious military officers, fresh from success on the battlefield, engage in any number of political behaviors that challenge the principles of civil-military relations. These are real concerns. However, I conceive the variable of military prestige as having already captured the effects of defeat and/or victory on the battlefield. In other words, I think it is important to allow for the possibility that either victory or defeat (and many levels in between) can improve or lessen the military's overall prestige. Thus, I do not foresee including defeat or victory in war as an important control variable. 

Given the theoretical expectation that the presence of conflict and/or threat environment can shape the willingness with which the military in particular adheres to the principles of civil-military relations, it is important to control for whether the US is involved in an external conflict where possible throughout the book. This raises additional concerns, however, mainly involving the fact that much of the quantitative data examined in this book is recent, and covers the post-September 11, 2001 era. This could be problematic in that to a certain extent, this era is one in which the US military was continuously deployed, particularly in Iraq and, until recently, Afghanistan. Still, there are various ways to control for the presence of conflict, which I do when appropriate throughout the book. 

### Norm Change

A second type of alternate explanation is one of norm change. This alternate explanation starts from the viewpoint that the principles of civil-military relations themselves -- civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference -- are all behavioral norms that have been constructed by the civilian and military actors over time. This alternate viewpoint, moreover, would explain any sharp change in the political behaviors that defy these norms as a routine process of changing the accepted norms of behavior. Such a viewpoint would emphasize that whereas the accepted norms of behavior used to include binding prohibitions against obvious incursions that violate the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference, these principles are no longer held or deemed as inviolable by the civilian and military actors who practice civil-military relations. Norm change as an alternate explanation is consistent with a rich set of literature within international relations that builds out of the constructivist tradition, and which views various actors such as states [@wendt_anarchy_1992] and organizations [@finnimore_international_1998] who create norms that shape their behavior. 

Norm change stands as a plausible alternate explanation, but it possesses one major flaw that, in my view, renders the likelihood of norm change explaining changing levels in political activity that violate the standards of civil-military relations exceedingly small in the United States. This is particularly true from the perspective of military actors, and less so from that of civilian leaders. 

This flaw is found in the fact that virtually every single official document that aspirationally guides the behavior of military today emphatically states or implies the principles that have been derived thus far in this book. Army Doctrinal Publication 6-22, _Army Leadership and the Profession_, for instance, notes in its first few pages that the Army profession is "a trusted vocation of Soldiers and Army civilians whose collective expertise is the ethical design, generation, support, and application of landpower; serving under Civilian authority; and entrusted to defend the Constitution and the rights and interests of the American people" [@united_states_army_adp_2019, ix]. Similar language emphasizing the principle of civilian control is found in several other places throughout the document [see for instance @united_states_army_adp_2019, 1-6, 1-9 ]. Other documents, such as Department of Defense Directive 1344.10, dated February 19, 2008, prohibit service members from committing certain types of activities that violate the military's non-partisan ethic [@department_of_defense_political_2008]. It is clear that the military as an organization, then, has not reduced its commitment to upholding the central principles of civil-military relations.^[I also make this argument in the historical case studies, particularly in Chapter 5 regarding the post-US Civil War period. To be clear, norms against political involvement by military actors were not as strongly developed in the 1870s as they are today. I address this issue in Chapter 5. Directly comparing military behavior from the 1870s against that in the 1980s might not be a great comparison, but I do argue that the ways in which the independent variables impact the dependent variable operate the same in both periods. For this reason, the historical case studies are not only appropriate, but can greatly round out this study.]  

And yet, I do not deny that perhaps the organization's members no longer feel as bound as they perhaps once were to uphold these central principles. Indeed, a significant aspect of my book is acknowledgement of and explanation for this being the case. Perhaps some military (and civilian) actors commit behaviors simply because they see others engaging in similar behaviors more often. In this way, norm change as an alternate explanation is still plausible. However, because the organization itself is still rather committed to upholding the central principles of civil-military relations, norm change is not likely the major driver of any recent change in levels of political activity. 

## Section 4: Summary and Way Forward

This chapter developed a theory which argued that the two independent variables of political polarization and military prestige combine to impact the dependent variable --- specific instances, types, and patterns of political behavior involving the military by civilian and military actors. The theory also posited that the independent variables impact the dependent variable through an intervening variable, which is the constraining influence of the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference of the military. 

The theory argued in this chapter holds that high levels of polarization provide a motive for military actors to behave in ways that challenge or violate the standards of civil-military relations [@finer_man_1962]. This occurs, as argued herein, because increasing political polarization reflects disagreement in the populace not only about specific policy matters, but about the moral values and worldviews that should govern society, to what extent, and why. When polarization is high, military actors are increasingly willing to challenge civilian leaders, adopt positions that align with partisan entities and organizations, and advocate for the military to weigh in on or solve problems that are indirectly related to national security and defense. Military actors are increasingly willing to engage in these sorts of behaviors because doing so advances the worldview or moral values held by these actors.  

In addition, it is herein argued that high levels of military prestige provide both military and civilian actors with an opportunity to use the military to influence public opinion [@finer_man_1962]. High levels of military prestige reflect a military that is trusted and respected by the public, and both civilian and military actors are cognizant of this reality. For this reason, holding all else equal, a highly prestigious military has a greater potential of committing or being asked to commit (by civilian leaders) behaviors that violate one or more of the principles of civil-military relations. 

Finally, the theory contends that both polarization and prestige need to be considered in tandem to determine the relative level of political activity that will occur in domestic political environments marked by the presence or absence of high polarization and prestige. When both the motive and opportunity to commit behaviors that violate one or more of the principles of civil-military relations exist, the resulting environment with respect to the conduct of civil-military relations promises to be tense. When neither motive nor opportunity are present, the environment for the conduct of civil-military relations is not perfect but is likely more tranquil. When either a motive or opportunity exist, but not the other, distinctions with respect to the level of overall political activity and which actor commits these activities is less clear. The next four chapters of the book test the predictive power of the theory with intent to sharpen our understanding of each of these four potential domestic environments. We now pivot to the first empirical chapter of the book.
