# Chapter 2 - Theory

This chapter develops a comprehensive theory explaining how and why the three central principles of civil-military relations, which were developed in the previous chapter, constrain the behavior of the civilian and military actors who conduct civil-military relations. The core argument developed in this chapter (and explored and tested throughout the rest of the book) is that these central principles of civil-military relations are not guaranteed to effectively constrain the behavior of civilian or military actors. Or to state it differently, the actors who conduct civil-military relations do not always adhere to the central principles of civil-military relations. Instead, this book argues that we have to consider two other variables when observing the degree to which civilian and military actors are constrained by the central principles of civil-military relations: political polarization and the prestige of the military. 

This chapter proceeds in four sections. The first provides an overview of the theory, defines the components of the theory, and shows how the components of the theory fit together. The second part describes how the variable levels of polarization and military prestige impact the constraining influence of the central principles of civil-military relations. This second section concludes with the presentation of hypotheses to be tested, analyzed, and explored throughout the book. The third section of the chapter examines alternative explanations and addresses endogeneity concerns within the theory. The fourth section summarizes the theory and briefly discusses the logic behind the empirical methodology employed in the empirical chapters that follow. 

## Section 1: Overview of the Theory

The core argument of this book is that the two independent variables of political polarization and military prestige influence an intervening variable, the constraining influence of the central principles of civil-military relations. This intervening variable in turn impacts the dependent variable, the political behaviors that military and civilian actors engage in that involve the military. A visual representation of this theory is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:overview). In the paragraphs below, I define the individual components of the theory in reverse order, beginning with the dependent variable.

### The Dependent Variable, Political Behaviors Involving the Military

In general, a political behavior involving the military is any action that invokes or harnesses the military for primarily a political purpose, or in a way that results in significant political impacts. Civilian and military actors can and often do engage in different types of these behaviors. But this general definition is not particularly helpful. As those who read Clausewitz know, militaries always accomplish generic political ends, and we can all agree that it is tough sometimes to know, both theoretically and practically, where the line between politics and the military should be drawn. 

Towards this end, the three central principles of civil-military relations can help us more precisely define political behaviors that involve the military. The political behaviors that we should be concerned about involving the military are those acts undertaken by civilian or military actors that violate one or more of the following central principles of civil-military relations: civilian control of the military, non-partisanship of the military institution, and military non-interference. 

There are at least two major advantages to developing and employing a framework that measures political behavior by adherence to the three central principles of civil-military relations. The first distinct advantage involves the sense of unity surrounding the primacy of these principles. As the last chapter argued, scholars such as Samuel Huntington as well as his critics share the aspirational ideal of military and civilian actors adhering to the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference of the military. This is helpful insofar as such a framework is already well positioned to meet at least some semblance of approval. 

But a second and perhaps greater advantage to identifying and measuring political behaviors through the lens of adherence to the central principles of civil-military relations is that such a framework can enable the measurement of civilian and military actor adherence to these principles over time. This is perhaps especially valuable in our current era, and particularly in the United States, where there seems to be much discussion and concern (at least in the late 2010s and early 2020s) in the culture about the military, its role in politics, and whether certain political leaders have overstepped their bounds on occasion by inappropriately involving the military in politics. The framework offered here, I attempt to show, can help us investigate such a question by comparing political behaviors involving the military in one period and comparing them to those undertaken by another. First, however, we need to better understand more specifically the types of political behaviors that military and civilian actors can engage in that involve the military. The following paragraphs explore such behaviors, beginning with those committed by military actors.

### Political Behaviors Available to Military Actors

Brooks (2009) notes that political behaviors undertaken by military actors are actions that are designed to influence "policy outcomes" or generate "political costs" that a civilian leader must contend with [@brooks_militaries_2009, 213]. Such a definition is consistent with the broad definition above, i.e., any action that invokes or harnesses the military for a primarily political purpose. 

It would be difficult --- perhaps impossible --- to render an exhaustive list of these political behaviors available to military actors. However, we can conceive of these behaviors existing along a theoretical spectrum. At one end of the spectrum are behaviors that tend to be bold, obvious, and deliberately intended to alter policy outcomes or partisan futures. Two such behaviors are acts of "explicit insubordination" by the military and "politicking," a behavior that would include things like endorsing political candidates for office or organizing voting drives [@brooks_militaries_2009, 213]. What is important to note here is that military actors who engage in these particular behaviors are in almost every case, by definition, violating the principle of civilian control (in the case of explicit insubordination) and non-partisanship of the military (in the case of politicking).^[The act of resignation in protest is one behavior that scholars differ with respect to whether such behavior is normatively inappropriate. Many, such as @m_shields_introduction_2017 and @golby_beyond_2015 view the behavior as an overtly political act of defiance and thus normatively wrong for military officers to engage in. Other scholars instead argue that a military officer's moral agency should at least allow for the possibility that resignation is not only appropriate, but a justified and necessary outcome, particularly in response to an immoral order which violates the officer's moral conscience. For such views, see @dubik_principled_2014; @snider_strategic_2014; and @milburn_breaking_2010.] 

At the opposite end of the spectrum are behaviors that tend to be far more subtle --- perhaps not even fully visible to observers --- and which are not always deliberately intended to alter policy of partisan outcomes. Three such behavior types include those of forming alliances with civilian interest groups, lobbying in pursuit of a particular cause, and selectively providing advice or complying with civilian directives.^[Brooks (2009) calls the first two of these behaviors "alliance building" and "shoulder tapping".] It is important to point out that due to both the subtlety of these behaviors, as well as the variety of goals that military actors may seek to achieve by engaging in those behaviors, it is not always clear whether such acts violate one or more of the central principles of civil-military relations. 

Observers would want to know more about what goal military actors pursued by engaging in behavior such as lobbying and forming alliances, and even then, final judgments could prove difficult. Consider the hypothetical case of military actors allying with Congressional leaders in order to pass legislation designed to curb veteran suicide --- a problematic issue that has gained more attention in recent years. On the surface, we would likely conclude that such behavior is not inappropriately political, and thus does not violate the principles of civil-military relations. But we might conclude differently if, for example, the military actors in this hypothetical case were primarily forming alliances with Congressional leaders from one political party at the exclusion of another, a development that could present the behavior as partisan in nature. Similar difficulties may arise in the case of military actors partially complying or slow-rolling a legitimate Congressional directive. Observers would need to show moderately compelling evidence that such behavior was deliberately political, and not simply the military giving other tasks higher priority.^[See @brooks_paradoxes_2020 for a recent example of the military providing selective advice, particularly with respect to how senior US military leaders shaped their advice to civilian leaders regarding the surge to Afghanistan in the early stages of the Obama Administration.] 

Somewhere between the ends of this theoretical spectrum, however, fall a host of other political behaviors that are not subtle, and furthermore, which may or may not violate the principles of civil-military relations, depending on how such behaviors are committed and the greater context in which these behaviors occur. The behavior of a military actor running for office is one such behavior. Two factors need to be examined in the case of this particular behavior are the timing of the candidate's announcement for political office relative to his or her military service, and the degree to which the candidate harnesses his or her record of military service while campaigning for political office. As to the first factor, it would be important to ask whether the military actor declared his or her candidacy for political office after his or her military service was completed, or before. Assuming the military actor did not declare himself or herself for office while serving on active duty, this study's view is that the military actor did not violate the principle of non-partisanship by engaging in such a behavior. 

The second factor --- the degree to which the military actor harnesses his or her own military service while running for office --- is more complicated. Is it wrong for a political candidate who is also a veteran to showcase one's military service in an attempt to garner votes? Unsatisfactory as the answer may be to some, a fair answer would be that it depends. For example, long-serving Republican Senator Lindsey Graham appeared in his military uniform after retiring as a Colonel in the US Air Force [@troyan_grahams_2015]. Such an example stands in stark contrast, however, to the case of an active duty military officer actively who campaigned for the US House of Representatives in 2021 while wearing a military uniform [@beynon_army_2021], a case that clearly violated the principle of non-partisanship.  

Another obvious behavior that may or may not violate the central principles of civil-military relations is that of writing opinion commentary (a behavior that is examined in systematic fashion in the following chapter). When General Colin Powell, while serving as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the early 1990s, wrote a series of op-eds in which he articulated his views regarding the use of force, his behavior generated political costs for Bill Clinton --- a political candidate when Powell's first op-ed was published who then became President [@powell_opinion_1992; @powell_us_1992]. Moreover, engagement in this behavior --- by a highly respected and the nation's top military figure --- undoubtedly influenced public opinion, and thus constrained the options available to President Clinton as a number of crises erupted in the Balkans, Somalia, Haiti, and Rwanda. In my own personal view, Powell's actions in this instance violated the principle of civilian control of the military. Yet not every op-ed penned by a military actor criticizes the commander-in-chief's foreign policy. When retired admirals and generals write op-eds about the importance of remembering our nation's fallen on Memorial Day, for instance, they are not creating political costs for the President to contend with. 

Table \@ref(tab:pol-behav) lists and describes several types of political behaviors that military actors may engage in. Several of these behaviors were first theorized by Risa Brooks (2009), but I have built upon her typology by adding several additional types of behaviors and by placing them in a general order of severity [@brooks_militaries_2009, 219]. That is, near the top of the table are those behaviors that by definition tend to violate the principles of civil-military relations. As discussed in this section, these include the behaviors of explicit acts of insubordination and partisan politicking. The table also includes six other behaviors which, unlike the top two, are those that may or not be inappropriately political, depending on various facets relating to _how_ such behaviors are conducted and the _context_ in which these behaviors occur.

### Political Behaviors Available to Civilians

Like military actors, civilians can also engage in behaviors that harness the military for political purposes. A good definition of political behaviors by civilians that adversely "politicize" the military comes from Jim Golby's (2021) concept of "civilian activation," which he defines as efforts "by civilian political elites to court or co-opt the military for personal, partisan, or electoral gain" [@golby_uncivil-military_2021, 153]. Scholars of comparative politics have long noted the behaviors civilian leaders may engage in that involve the military, particularly for the purposes of consolidating their hold on power. For instance, Quinlivan (1999) articulates a series of "coup proofing" behaviors civilians may undertake in order to prevent military forces from launching a coup, such as establishing "parallel" militaries who hold a "special loyalty" to the regime in power [@quinlivan_coup-proofing_1999]. Similar civilian efforts are described and articulated by De Bruin as "counterbalancing" behaviors [@de_bruin_will_2019]. 

Though such examples are thought to occur primarily in autocratic or weakly democratic regimes, there are nonetheless a host of political behaviors that civilian leaders mature democracies can undertake in mature democracies that involve the military and which seek to further a leader's political or partisan advantages. Before diving into these behaviors, it is important to note that just as contextual factors were important to consider when examining political behaviors conducted by military actors, so too it is vital to examine contextual facets when assessing behaviors committed by civilians that involve the military. This may be even more important than in the the case of military actors, for as Golby notes, "elected political leaders often provide alternative explanations to legitimize or excuse their behavior," and observers cannot readily or easily observe the "intent" of the civilian actors who engage in such behaviors [@golby_uncivil-military_2021, 152].

Again conceiving the range of possible political behaviors that civilian actors can undertake within mature democracies as a spectrum, we can envision one end consisting of those behaviors that are committed exclusively for partisan or political advantage. These would include acts such as partisan stacking, which involves Presidents appointing military actors to positions primarily on the basis of shared partisan or ideological alignment, or diversionary deployments, which involves Presidents engaging in act of military force at home or abroad in order to divert the public's attention away from some other (usually domestic) political issue or set of issues.^[The act of civilians appointing officers on the basis of shared partisan convictions is one manifestation of what Huntington called "subjective civilian control." See @huntington_soldier_1957, 80-81 for more details.] In both cases, such behaviors would likely violate at least the principle of non-partisanship. By appointing military officers on the basis of partisan or ideological advantage instead of merit, a President has violated the principle of non-partisanship in obvious ways, as partisan alignment has replaced objective qualification the most important criteria for attaining to a higher rank or position. And by engaging in a diversionary deployment, a President has violated the principle of non-partisanship because in so doing, the President is likely seeking to reduce the domestic political pressure he or she is facing.^[One such example involves President Donald Trump's deployment of several thousand troops to the US border with Mexico in the fall of 2018 in response to an impending caravan of migrants approaching the US from South America. Some observers saw the move as a type of political move ahead of that year's midterm elections, including several retired Army Colonels who penned an op-ed titled, "Trump's Border Stunt Is a Profound Betrayal of Our Military." See @adams_trumps_2018 for more details. At the same time, others saw the move not as a politically motivated use of the military, but rather as a drastic yet shrewd response to a legitimate crisis that had developed on the US southern border. For such a viewpoint, see @wright_trumps_2018. Whether the move was inappropriately diversionary or properly decisive depends largely on the observer's point of view.] Other behaviors near this end of the spectrum include that of the use military actors to speak at major partisan gatherings (such as political conventions), or to explicitly endorse or attack political candidates during political campaigns. These instances of electoral swaggering committed by a civilian would almost certainly violate, at a minimum, the principle of military non-partisanship.  

On the other end of the spectrum lie behaviors that likely involve the military for partisan advantage, but in a far more subtle form, and to a far less degree. Suppose, for instance, that a Presidential candidate seeks to garner support for his or her healthcare plan. The candidate asks an elderly military veteran to travel with him or her in order to publicly affirm the candidate's plan, a behavior that would fall under what I call the category of "the military as sales reps". Perhaps such behavior involves the veteran standing up during town halls, or being asked to briefly affirm during political debates that the candidate's healthcare plan indeed takes care of the nation's veterans in a satisfactory manner. There is no doubt that such behavior seeks to leverage the military for partisan gain broadly speaking, but in this case, the political candidate is using a much subtler means (an elderly veteran talking about the specific issue of veteran healthcare) than, for instance, employing a prominent military actor at a political convention (a retired general or admiral endorsing the candidate for office). Use of the military as sales reps can take on other forms as well. Some observers, for example, alleged that President George W. Bush's use of General David Petraeus, an immensely popular military figure, to garner Congressional support for the Iraq "surge" strategy in 2007-2008 politicized the military in unhealthy ways [@coll_generals_2008]. Others disagreed on the grounds that the former general, having both the knowledge and experience from having served previously in Iraq, was precisely the right individual to speak to Congress about the new strategy.

Several other political behaviors available to civilian actors may similarly violate one or more principles of civil-military relations, again depending on how and why each might be undertaken. One example is that of "showcasing the Troops," which could include civilian political candidates who, in the course of running for office, feature generic military images and symbols in their campaign ads (a behavior that is explored in detail in chapter four). The common practice of featuring general images of US Troops while patriotic music plays in the background of a political advertisement is likely not problematic. However, if an advertisement instead features images which contain the faces of recognizable senior military leaders in uniform, while the narrator simultaneously states, "Candidate X is trusted by the military to defend the nation," such an advertisement is more problematic, as it directly conveys a partisan connection between the candidate seeking office and the particular military officers shown in the ad.^[In the latter instance, assuming the military officers whose faces were featured in the advertisement were not given a chance to refuse appearing in the ad, the civilian actor (either the candidate or the candidate's campaign team) has committed an inappropriate political behavior.If the officers did agree to appear in the campaign ad, the behavior would still be inappropriate, but the responsibility would be shared between the civilian candidate and the military actors.]

Instances of Presidents visiting and engaging US Troops, either at home or abroad, is another form of showcasing the Troops that can likewise be controversial. These instances may or may not violate principles of civil-military relations. Presidents have long visited military bases to meet and interact with Troops, make major policy announcements, and in the case of visiting service academies, to preside over officer commissioning ceremonies. President Trump's visit to Iraq in 2018 generated a moderate level of controversy, however, because as some critics alleged, the President's visit had more the look and feel of a partisan campaign stop than that of a Commander in Chief visiting the Troops. Indeed, some of the Troops reportedly adorned hats and other "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) gear during the President's visit, which the President happily signed [@fritze_trump_2018]. The President's visit in and of itself was not problematic. However, the way in which some of the Troops appeared to endorse the President in clearly partisan tones _was_ problematic.

Another behavior available to political actors that is both controversial and that may or may not violate the principles of civil-military relations is that of placing "brass in the cabinet." This behavior involves civilian actors who appoint military actors, civilian or retired, to key positions within the government. This behavior is fairly common. For instance, Presidents George W. Bush, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden all appointed prominent military figures to key civilian billets in their administrations.^[President George W. Bush appointed General (Retired) Colin Powell as his Secretary of State. President Donald Trump appointed a number of active and retired flag officers to positions of prominence, including Army Lieutenant General (Retired) Mike Flynn and later, Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster as his National Security Advisors, Marine Corps General (Retired) James Mattis as Secretary of Defense, and Marine Corps General (Retired) Michael Kelly as White House Chief of Staff. President Joe Biden appointed Army General (Retired) Lloyd Austin as Secretary of Defense.] There is little consensus to determine at what point such behavior becomes problematic, but two factors include the prevalence of such behavior (which could be measured by examining the percentage of key, top-tier civilian positions filled by retired military officers) and the retired rank of those appointed to such positions. This second factor in particular addresses concerns aimed at the degree to which civilian positions are in fact filled by civilians. 

Table \@ref(tab:pol-behav-civ) lists and describes several types of political behaviors that civilian actors may choose to undertake that involve the military. Some behaviors, such as partisan stacking and diversionary deployment, contain clearly partisan currents, while others, as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, involve a far greater degree of subtlety. Unlike in the case of military actors, observers must remember that civilian political actors are to a certain extent inherently partisan creatures, a reality that can complicate rendering decisive judgments regarding instances of behavior that violate principles of civil-military relations. This word of caution is not intended to provide excuses for civilian actors to behave in ways that challenge the norms of democratic civil-military relations so much as to draw the reader's attention to the fact that judgments involving civilian actors and some types of behaviors tend to prove more difficult.

Together, Tables \@ref(tab:pol-behav) and \@ref(tab:pol-behav-civ) show that the behaviors available to military and civilian actors involving the military exist on relative spectrums, where some types of behavior almost certainly violate one or more principles of civil-military relations, whereas other types of subtle behaviors may not always do so. The tables also illumine for the reader some of the contextual factors to consider when attempting to determine whether certain behaviors in fact violate one or more of these central principles. With the dependent variable studied in this book explained and defined, we now shift focus to examining the two independent variables of this study, political polarization and military prestige. I define each of these variables in turn, tracing the respective level of each in contemporary America.

## Political Polarization

In the academic discipline of political science, polarization generally refers to the movement of thoughts and attitudes within a political community away from the political center and toward more ideological extremes [@hare_polarization_2014; @abramowitz_great_2018]. Pulling on this thread a bit more, we can state that the level of polarization describes the degree to which a society shares fundamental values, is capable of incorporating divergent worldviews in the political sphere, and the overall degree to which a state's values unite or divide a nation [@marsden_twilight_2014; @deneen_why_2018]. 

In this book, I rely on a definition of polarization that is consistent with these descriptions, yet one that includes much clearer and obvious moral --- even theological --- undertones. More precisely, polarization in this book denotes the degree to which public contestation exists in the political sphere over issues that squarely involve what theologians refer to as the concept of the _image of God_. Where there is political polarization, there will also be contestation over _the image of God_ and how concerns concerning _the image of God_ features into our political issues and debates. 

The following section first defines the _image of God_ and argues that the concept is important in political life --- especially, but not only, for those who believe that mankind is made in the _image of God_. Second, the section then describes America's contemporary polarizing environment. In doing so, I connect the scholarship between political scientists and those from other scholarly fields to argue that my contention --- that when heightened polarization exists, there is increased contestation over political issues that involve the concept of _the image of God_ --- is at least plausible, if not likely. 

The third section broadly orients the reader to the levels of political polarization in United States history. Here I assert that in the years leading up to and after the US Civil War, when political polarization existed at a relatively high level in the United States, this polarization was driven in fact by political debates and concern over slavery and civil rights for African Americans, two political issues that are highly connected to the concept of _the image of God_. This assertions helps strengthen the linkage I am making between the variable of polarization and how I am defining it, i.e., the presence of contestation over political issues that involve _the image of God._

Before diving in, I want to clearly state that what I have in mind by the variable of polarization as the contestation of political issues involving the _image of God_ is not the same thing as secularism, or the erosion of religious belief in society. To see this, we should note that one of America's most polarizing eras --- the years leading up to, during, and after the US Civil War --- was not an especially secular era, at least relative to the contemporary US, where the percentage of adults who claim no religious beliefs has risen sharply over the past several decades [@white_rise_2014]. I will contend, however, that in both the mid-19th Century and the modern day United States is that several political issues divided citizens sharply, resulting in high degrees of polarization, because those issues dealt significantly with issues matters pertaining to the concept of _the image of God_.  

### The Image of God

The concept of the image of God stems in part from Genesis 1:26-27, which in the English Standard Version of the Bible reads, "Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.' So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them." God goes on to "bless them" (verse 28), and commands them to "be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth" (verse 29).

In the biblical storyline, God himself spoke these words as He finalized his creation of the Earth by making the very first man and woman. For millenia, scholars and theologians have debated the full meaning of what it means for men and women to be made in the image of God. And while I cannot present the full range of views on this topic here, the works of even just a few scholars can help establish a general understanding of the image of God and what it means for politics.^[For just two of the possible works to explore on the image of God, see @kilner_dignity_2015 and @vandrunen_divine_2014.] 

First, to be made in the image of God means that mankind, unlike other objects that God made during creation (such as animals, rocks, and trees), has characteristics that are similar to God himself. Scholars have generally taken these characteristics to at least include the traits of "rationality" and "moral responsibility" [@vandrunen_politics_2020, 59].^[According to the theologian Wayne Grudem, the likenesses that mankind has stemming from being made in the image of God involve "moral, spiritual, mental, relational, and physical" aspects. See @grudem_systematic_1994, 445-449.] Second, and perhaps more substantively, being made in God's image denotes a strong sense of purpose for mankind on the earth. All men and women are image bearers of God who possess a "divine commission to exercise benevolent rule in this world as God's representative and under his authority" [@vandrunen_politics_2020, 59]. To put it very simply, "the fact that man is in the image of God means that man is like God and represents God" [@grudem_systematic_1994, 442].

Moreover, that mankind is made in God's image implies much for our political life, the high contours of which I can only touch on here due to space considerations. The first involves the universality of who is made in God's image. Indeed, God fashioned the entire human race with a likeness to himself, and not just a certain group of people. All human beings are therefore made in the image of God, and thus each possesses equal worth, honor, and dignity. A second implication of mankind made in the image of God involves the order, or the hierarchy, of the creation. As the creator, God is the center and the origin of the universe. While mankind is made in God's image, questions and issues of moral right and wrong --- the moral order --- are informed first and foremost by God, and not by men.^[Of course, a significant question that then arises is how can human beings who do not believe in the God of the Bible still know what moral right and wrong are? Jews and Christians generally respond by suggesting that God has a natural law that is communicated to mankind through several aspects of the natural created world itself. For more on this topic, see @vandrunen_politics_2020, 124-150.] A third implication stemming from mankind made in God's image involves the general duties and responsibilities that men and women assume as God's image bearers in the world. In other words, human beings that are made in the image of God are to live their lives in a way that honors God and his character.^[As prominent evangelical Pastor and author John Piper explains, "images are created to image...God created us in his image so that we would display or reflect or communicate who he is, how great he is, and what he is like." See @piper_what_2013 for more.]

Taking these three implications together --- that every person is made in the image of God and thus possesses equal worth, that God created and is at the head of the moral order, that we as humans have a responsibility to live in such a way that honors this Creator God --- it becomes clear that at least for those who take the concept of the image of God seriously, they cannot easily divorce the image of God from their politics in any meaningful sense.^[The entire field of political theology explores questions related to this topic.] Indeed, as Wayne Grudem notes, the concept of the image of God "has profound implications for our conduct toward others. It means that people of every race deserve equal dignity and rights. It means that elderly people, those seriously ill, the mentally retarded, and children yet unborn, deserve full protection and honor as human beings" [@grudem_systematic_1994, 450]. Said differently, how one thinks about the concept of the image of God impacts how one thinks about several of life's perhaps most vital questions, including: what is a human being, what does it mean to be created male and female, what obligations do I owe my fellow human beings, and what is the purpose of my existence.^[The answers to these and other important questions, many of which involve the concept of the image of God, help form our worldview. Worldview is a concept that Sire (2020) has defined as "a commitment, a fundamental orientation of the heart...about the basic constitution of reality, and that provides the foundation on which we live and move and have our being." See @sire_universe_2020, 6-9 for a more-detailed explanation.]

### Connecting Polarization and the Image of God in Politics

Having defined the concept of the image of God, the next step in my argument consists of demonstrating a strong theoretical linkage between heightened political polarization in the United States and contestation over issues that squarely impact the image of God in political life. To see this, we will first examine what polarization is strictly defined as, as well as diagnoses of contemporary polarization in the US. These diagnoses do not directly mention the concept of the image of God. 

We will then examine several observations made by scholars from outside of the field of political science concerning key aspects of contemporary American culture. When combined with the previous diagnoses of polarization, these observations point in a direction consistent with my contention: that heightened political polarization occurs when significant contestation exists in the political sphere over issues that squarely involve the image of God. For clarity in my argument, I am not suggesting that there is never a disagreement about how the image of God should be followed and applied in our politics. What I am suggesting is that there are times when the political issues we face more closely involve questions related to morality and the created order than other times. And it is during these times, when heightened contestation exists concerning how the image of God should be applied to the political issues citizens face, that polarization will be present.     

Political scientists who study polarization note that polarization has been especially heightened in recent years. But it is not so easy to diagnose why this has been the case. Allen Abramowitz, one of the world's leading experts on polarization, explains the causes of America's contemporary polarizing politics as "fundamentally, a disagreement over the dramatic changes that have transformed American society and culture since the end of World War Two, and that continue to have huge effects in the twenty-first century" [@abramowitz_great_2018, x]. Sides, Tesler, and Vavreck (2018) argue similarly that the US has undergone profound changes over the past several decades, and specifically describe the 2016 Presidential Election --- in which Donald Trump defeated the heavily favored Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton --- as "symptomatic of a broader American identity crisis," and that "issues like immigration, racial discrimination, and the integration of Muslims boil down to competing visions of American identity and inclusiveness" [@sides_identity_2018, 10]. These scholars assert that the US is not as cohesive, at least in many respects, as it perhaps once was.  

There are also at least three features of today's polarized environment in America noted by political scientists that deserve emphasis. The first is that polarization goes far beyond political differences harbored between political elites. Average and everyday citizens who identify as Democrats simply dislike those who identify as Republicans, and vice versa, at greater levels than previously seen. This phenomenon has been coined "affective polarization" [@iyengar_affect_2012; @iyengar_origins_2019; @abramowitz_great_2018]. A second feature is the increasing scope of the partisan battleground. Politicians and citizens do not disagree and wage political war over a handful of important issues, but rather over what seems like everything, a dynamic that has been called "conflict extension" [@layman_party_2002; @layman_activists_2010]. A third feature of politics in the US today is the seemingly non-stop nature of identity politics. As any contemporary observer can attest to, group identities and political interests are heavily bound up together in issues concerning the topics of race, gender, religion, and immigration [@white_values_2002; @mann_its_2012; @sides_identity_2018]. 

Thus, contemporary polarization in the US can be described as a relative erosion of cohesion brought about by profound differences in the way people see the type of country that America should be and what it should stand for. These differences, furthermore, tend to be especially exacerbated over particular issues, which likely explains why our polarized environment is associated with an increase in identity politics. Finally, the contemporary polarized environment is one in which the scope of the political background seems to have expanded.   
Now we will explore observations made by scholars from outside of the field of political science on the topic of contemporary American culture. Carl Trueman, a church historian and cultural theologian, argues that many of the modern political debates and issues in the West today --- especially those that involve issues of sexuality such as the entire LGBTQ+ movement --- are not so much problems that cause political polarization, but rather symptoms of a massive change that has occurred over the past decades and even centuries involving how society views notions of selfhood and identity. Whereas individuals in previous societies generally accepted that the individual was not the center of the universe but rather part of a transcendent and sacred order, the modern notion of the self is ultra-focused on seeking pleasure, expressing one's self, and bucking historical notions of authority [@trueman_rise_2020]. This gradual but significant change has occurred, Truman argues, as various intellectual traditions rooted in the likes of Nietzche, Marx, Freud, Marcuse, and others have supplanted more-traditional and sacred origins of identity in our modern societies.^[One of the many intellectual traditions Trueman covers is the rise of critical theory. Trueman critiques critical theory, but is not entirely dismissive of it. Rather, Trueman explains why critical theory has been so successful in taking root in our politics, far outside of the academy, where it had been previously largely confined. See also @shenvi_critical_2023 for an excellent primer on critical theory.] 

Truman asserts that the quintessential contemporary issue that points to the rejection of a previously respected sacred order is the transgender rights movement. He asserts that underneath the questions of whether a person can or should change their gender, and if so, whether the same person ought to use a different type of bathroom, or play on a sports team that corresponds to that person's newly-selected gender, actually lies a "deeper rejection...of any and every sacred order..." [@trueman_rise_2020, 381].^[Although I focus on arguments made by Carl Trueman here, he is not alone in his critiques of contemporary American society. See also, for instance, @taylor_secular_2007.] In a similar vein as Truman, Renn (2022) notes that in less than 30 years (since 1994), American society has changed such that Christian morals and principles have gone from being seen as a generally positive thing to one in which they are now "expressly repudiated and seen as a threat to the public good and the new public moral order" [@renn_three_2022]. 

When we integrate the observations of political scientists with those made by Trueman and Renn above, we clearly see that contemporary polarization in the US is at least associated with issues that are rife with significant moral currents and undertones. More than this, though, it would seem that polarization especially deepens when the worldviews that seek to influence political issues are not merely comprised of different types, but rather when these worldviews are increasingly opposed to each other in fundamental ways, which is to say when the image of God is at risk. This assertion is consistent with Abramowitz (2018), who above argued that contemporary polarization in America is the result of "dramatic changes that have transformed American society," and with Sides, Tesler, and Vavreck, who point to the "competing visions of American identity and inclusiveness" that marked the 2016 Presidential Election, and with Trueman, who argues that changes in the concept of the self today "reject...the sacred order." 

The issue of abortion in contemporary US politics continues to show this reality in perhaps the clearest of ways, as abortion is perhaps the quintessential political issue that deals with facets of the image of God: what is a human life, when does a life begin, and who or what can terminate such a life, and for what reasons? One political party fights to preserve a woman's right to have an abortion, in recent years some Democrats advocating for abortions to be performed as late into a pregnancy as possible. Another political party has fought hard to curb abortion significantly, with few exceptions. 

At the risk of truncating what is a complex and divisive political topic, the important point here is that that common ground is unlikely to be found on such an issue, particularly when each side pursues vastly different objectives. Too much is at stake for those on both sides of the political aisle. Those who are against abortion routinely invoke the image of God along the lines by pointing out that life begins at conception, that all human beings are created by God, and therefore that only God can choose when to begin and end a life. Those who are against abortion are likely to find these arguments unconvincing, or less convincing than arguments that appeal to the health of the mother.

Table \@ref(tab:imago-dei-issues) captures several contemporary political topics in the United States. For each political issue, several acute questions exist that indicate how citizens feel towards a certain issue. Furthermore, for each issue, the table captures at least one instance of how the military has been impacted by the political issue, demonstrating that these are not topics that the military can avoid or stay away from altogether. Finally, the table distills how each political issue relates to the concept of the image of God.

### Polarization and the Image of God in the US Over Time

It is important to briefly understand how scholars measure polarization in the United States. In political science, one of the benchmark measurements of polarization in the United States has been that of dynamically-weighted, three-step estimation scores (DW-NOMINATE), which are derived from examining roll call voting patterns among members of Congress [@jeffrey_b_lewis_voteview_2020]. Figure \@ref(fig:polar-chamber) shows polarization levels present in the US House and Senate since the latter portions of the 19th Century [@hare_polarization_2014; @jeffrey_b_lewis_voteview_2020]. As Figure \@ref(fig:polar-chamber) demonstrates, polarization levels in the United States were very high around 1880, and remained high before gradually decreasing early in the 20th century. The figure further shows that polarization reached its nadir in the years before World War Two, then remained at relatively low levels until approximately the mid-1970s. Since that time, however, polarization in both chambers of the US Congress has increased steadily, to the point that contemporary levels now exceed those previously recorded.

The fact that polarization existed at an extremely high level after the end of the Civil War is not surprising and, furthermore, entirely consistent with the notion that polarization rises when the political issues that are at stake more squarely involve matters related to the image of God. Slavery and the resulting quest to secure civil rights for African Americans, including the US Civil War, were issues that involved the image of God in the most significant of ways. Even Abraham Lincoln the Presidential Candidate --- hardly an abolitionist --- invoked the image of God implicitly when forming his thoughts on how to debate Stephen Douglas, his Illinois political opponent, in the early 1850s. Lincoln Scholar Allan Guelzo recounts that Lincoln, "needed the morality of natural law, even of natural theology", to counter Douglas's stances on the doctrine of "popular sovereignty" when slavery threatened to be spread into the territories of Kansas and Nebraska [@guelzo_abraham_2010, 188].

Polarization has been measured in a second way in the American politics literature. First derived by Iyengar et al. (2012), measurements of "affective polarization" or "negative partisanship" have been derived by using data from the American National Elections Studies (ANES) [@iyengar_affect_2012]. Beginning in the late 1970s, the ANES has asked a series of "feeling thermometer" questions, in which respondents are asked to provide, on a scale ranging from 0-100, how they feel about a range of topics, including their feelings about political parties. Figure \@ref(fig:affect-polar) graphs the results of how partisans feel about members of their own party, members who affiliate with the opposite party, the difference between these two answers, and a total level of affective polarization, which is the sum of the difference for each of the two main parties in the United States. As Figure \@ref(fig:affect-polar) shows, measurements for how favorable each party is have remained more or less constant over the past several decades. However, partisans have increasingly rated those on the opposite side of the political spectrum as increasingly less favorable over the same time period. In other words, data shows that partisans do not necessarily like the party with whom they affiliate more, but rather that they disdain those on the other side of the aisle at greater levels.

### Summary - Why Polarization Matters

One does not have to look hard today at American political culture to notice our current levels of high polarization. Indeed, it is little wonder that both candidates running for President of the United States in 2020 claimed that the very "soul of the nation" was at stake [@dias_biden_2020]. Like anyone else, members of the US military are not immune from holding strong views and opinions on central questions that involve the concept of the image of God. As previously explained, these types of questions and issues tend to invoke deeply moral and often theological commitments. When central and consequential issues and concerns are at stake that relate to the image of God, members of the military and civilian actors will increasingly behave in a way that advances the values and worldview that they believe in, even if doing so runs counter to the central principles of civil-military relations.  

## Military Prestige 

The second independent variable examined in this study is military prestige. In defining prestige, I follow the sociological literature regarding the stratification of professional occupations and professions that denotes two related yet distinct components that comprise the variable of prestige [@davis_conceptual_1942; @jaco_prestige_1970]. The first component deals with how important an occupation or profession is in terms of its positional role in society, or what Davis (1942) calls, "the invidious value attached to any given status or office" [@davis_conceptual_1942, 312]. This first component of military prestige thus has in mind the relative _importance_ or _centrality_ of the military with respect to the function it serves and the roles or tasks it carries out. We might anticipate that the importance or centrality of the military varies as a result of factors such as the threat environment. For example, a society that lives under the constant threat of attack by another nation, and whose military is constantly working to ensure that these threats are defeated, may view its military as more central to the state than another society that rarely faces significant threats. 

The second component of prestige examines society's evaluation of the _performance_ or _excellence_ of an occupation or profession, or the manner in which its members "[carry] out the requirements of [their] position" [Linton, 1936 as cited in @davis_conceptual_1942, 312]. Applying this to the prestige of the military, this second component of prestige thus deals with the degree to which society deems the military is skilled. We might say that this component of prestige handles the degree to which the military meets society's expectations, or is judged to be competent by society. We might expect this component of military prestige to vary according to different factors than those that impact the _centrality_ of the military.^[This second component of military prestige is probably most similar to "public confidence" in the military, a variable that is explored in great detail by Peter Feaver in @feaver_thanks_2023. In this book, particularly in the empirical chapters, I rely on a measure of public confidence in the US military to serve as a proxy for military prestige] For example, whether the military is victorious in battle might impact society's evaluation of the skill of the military. So too may the presence of significant scandals within the military.

The distinction of these two components of military prestige matters insofar as that theoretically, the two components may operate at different levels simultaneously. It is possible, for instance, for a military to be viewed as highly central or important, but nonetheless not very skilled, or conversely, for a military to be relatively unimportant to society, yet rather skilled at the tasks society expects it to perform. Furthermore, it follows that changes to the overall level of military prestige may be driven by one or both of the components described above. For example, the US military victory during the Gulf War likely did not primarily alter the centrality of the military in terms of the centrality of the function it provided the United States. The military had, well before the Gulf War, occupied a central role --- defending the nation --- throughout the Cold War period. But the victory in the Gulf War did change how Americans perceived the military's overall skill and professionalism. When President George H.W. Bush proclaimed, in 1991, that "It's a proud day for America. And, by God, we've kicked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all," his comments pointed to the fact that the US military had shed any lingering perceptions or doubts regarding its abilities, dating back to the end of the Vietnam War [@bush_george_1991].^[Senior military leaders who participated in the Gulf War likewise viewed that victory as the signature expression of an Army that had, in the two decades after Vietnam, rebuilt itself. See @kitfield_prodigal_1997.] 

The following section traces the contemporary US military's high level of prestige through each of the two components described above. With respect to the military's centrality to the nation, the following section shows that for a majority of the post-World War Two era, the US military has played a central role in American foreign policy. With respect to society's perception of the military's professional excellence, the section then describes how society's level of public trust in the military has changed over the past several decades. Today, the modern, all-volunteer military is somewhat exclusive and distant from many segments of American society, and fewer Americans can relate to the military writ large. This has rendered the military institution increasingly popular, but also somewhat mysterious.   

### The Centrality of the Military Institution

Over the past seventy-five years, the United States instituted a series of significant bureaucratic reforms that significantly expanded the military's scope and influence within the government. As a result, the military has become a massive organization that for some time has influenced a wide range of foreign policy and national security outcomes. This has especially been the case since the end of World War Two, when shortly afterward, President Truman signed The National Security Act of 1947 in order to unify the defense and intelligence establishments. Despite emerging victorious in Europe and in the Pacific, World War Two had shown that the military services had squabbled  quite a bit [@kaiser_no_2014]. Among other reforms, The National Security Act created new institutions such as the National Security Council (NSC), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the US Air Force [@noauthor_national_1947], and more formally, merged the Departments of War and Navy into the "National Military Establishment," which essentially served as the precursor to what became the Department of Defense in 1949 [@locher_has_2001]. These reforms wrought by the National Security Act were not only reflective of the central role that the nation's military would play in international affairs in the years to come, but they also proved to be quite successful.^[So influential was the National Security Act that fifty years after its signing, President Bill Clinton stated that as a result of the institutions created by the National Security Act and the people who had served in them, a generation had "helped to secure the peace and prosperity that America enjoys...the success of their efforts and of the historic legislation enacted half a century ago is reflected in an outstanding record of achievement: nuclear war averted, the Cold War won, and the nations of the world turning to democracy and free markets." See @clinton_weekly_1997 for more details.] 

Decades later, the military underwent a second set of institutional defense reforms known as the Goldwater-Nichols Act in the 1980s. Named after Senator Barry Goldwater and Congressman William "Bill" Nichols, several incidents occurred in the early 1980s that exposed deficiencies in several aspects of US military operations, including that the individual services lacked the requisite ability to operate in _joint_ environments, or those which required personnel and equipment from across the individual military services [@kitfield_prodigal_1997].^[This included the the failed Iranian hostage rescue mission in 1980. For an excellent account of how this tragic event spurred the evolution of joint military organizations and doctrine, see @kitfield_prodigal_1997.] The ultimate goal of the Goldwater-Nichols Act was to ensure that in an age in which military technologies and equipment were becoming increasingly sophisticated, American national defense interests would be identified and prioritized over and above the parochial organizational interests of the individual and separate military services [@locher_has_2001]. Importantly, among the most significant of the changes wrought by the Goldwater-Nichols Act was codification of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as the President's principal military adviser, a change which meant that all advice from the respective individual service chiefs of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps would flow through the new Chairman [@locher_has_2001; @wills_effect_2016]. Also important, the Goldwater-Nichols Act created several regional combatant commanders, each of whom would report directly to the Secretary of Defense [@locher_has_2001; @wills_effect_2016]. In essence, the Goldwater-Nichols act institutionalized both the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combatant Commanders as incredibly powerful military positions.  

A further source of the contemporary military's importance to the nation involves the widening scope of responsibility the military has assumed, especially in the post-9/11 era. Although the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq each involved a sizable civilian component for at least a portion of the wars, the military nonetheless assumed control for a significant portion of the day-to-day decision making of these conflicts, even over issues that once were, at least ostensibly, primarily civilian responsibilities.^[The topic of the interaction (or lack thereof) of military and civilian efforts during the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts has become a burgeoning literature that includes a mixture of official government reports, autobiographical memoirs, and works that offer other theoretical and historical insights. For a sample of this literature, see @iraq_study_group_us_iraq_2006; @ricks_fiasco_2006; @chandrasekaran_imperial_2007; @hodge_armed_2011; @chandrasekaran_little_2013; @gallagher_day_2019.] So central has the military become as a result of the legislative changes wrought over the past several decades, combined with nearly two decades of overseas experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, that one scholar has argued that in essence the Pentagon has replaced the State Department as the government's "organizational center of gravity for U.S. national security and foreign policy" [@schmidt_silent_2019].^[Another scholar states that the US military's institutional influence has become so powerful that asking for "Pentagon 'help' is like being hugged by an eight-hundred-pound gorilla: it can squeeze the life right out of civilian efforts." See @brooks_how_2016, 91 for more details] 

Examining the Defense Department's budget relative to the Department of State's shows the military's relative centrality within the government. Figure \@ref(fig:dodstate-budgets) displays each department's total budget in 2016 real dollars between 1962-2016. One can clearly detect that though the size of the Defense budget has dwarfed that of State for a number of decades, the relative degree to which the Defense budget is larger than the State Department's has especially grown sharply in the post-9/11 era.^[In the empirical chapters of the book, the predominant measures of military prestige rely on measurements of public trust and confidence in the military, as reported through various public opinion polling. The relative size of the DoD versus State Department Budget could also be used, but these budgetary differences likely also reflect institutional developments, such as the advent of the All-Volunteer Force, which is very expensive to maintain. For this reason, public opinion measurements of trust and confidence in the military are better (though still imperfect) measures of the military's overall level of prestige, and are used throughout the book.]

```

### The Military's Skill & Expertise

The second factor comprising the military's high level of prestige involves society's perceptions of the military's skill or excellence. There are few direct measurements of this component specifically, but a closely-related measurement is the degree of public trust --- or confidence --- that Americans place in the military.^[The definitive work on public confidence and the US Military is @feaver_thanks_2023. One of the key findings in the book, which relies on novel survey data taken in the 2019-2020 period, is that there appear to be several broad factors that influence public confidence in the military, including performance, professional ethics, partisanship, and peer pressure. But, because the book relies on survey data, Feaver notes that it is not possible to state if these factors are responsible for changes over time in the levels of public confidence in the military.  See @feaver_thanks_2023, p.90 for more details.]

```

While recent polls show that trust in the military may in fact be slipping [@mcintyre_people_2021], the fact is that relative to other institutions, Americans greatly respect their military. According to recent Gallup public opinion polls, 72 percent of Americans indicate that they trust the military a "great deal" or "quite a lot" -- the most of any institution, to include Congress (13%), the Presidency (39%), the police (48%), the Supreme Court (40%), and the church/organized religion (42%) [@noauthor_confidence_2020]. Moreover, trends in trust of various American institutions over time reveal that, whereas trust in the military has generally increased over the past 45 years, trust in the other institutions has generally declined or remained the same. These trends are displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:insttrust).

While the previous paragraphs are intended to describe societal evaluations of the military as an institution, it is important to at least allow for an individual dimension, too. Military leaders can become widely popular, particularly if they earn fame and renown for achieving success on the battlefield, such as Generals George Washington, Ulysses S. Grant, Douglas MacArthur, Dwight Eisenhower, David Petraeus, and many other military figures in American history. In this book, I argue that when the prestige of the military is high, civilian and military actors possess a greater opportunity to use the military in ways to leverage public opinion relative to when military prestige is low. Furthermore, when military prestige is high, I argue that civilian and military actors may be less inclined to act in ways that adhere to and are consistent with the fundamental principles of civil-military relations.

## Section 2 :How Polarization and Prestige Impact the Constraining Influence of the Central Principles of Civil-Military Relations
\doublespace

Having defined both the dependent and independent variables in this chapter, and having defined the central principles of civil-military relations in the previous chapter, we can now blend these elements into a cohesive theory. First, I argue that high levels of political polarization provide a _motive_ for military leaders to engage in political behaviors that challenge the central principles of civil-military relations. Then, I argue that a high level of military prestige provides _both_ military and civilian leaders with an _opportunity_ to do the same  [@finer_man_1962]. Finally, I argue that the combination of relative levels of polarization and military prestige lead to the formulation of four distinct domestic political environments in which civil-military relations occur.

\singlespace
### Polarization - A "Motive" to Challenge the Principles of Civil-Military Relations
\doublespace

Increasing polarization serves as a _motive_ for military actors to behave in ways that violate the central principles of civil-military relations. This occurs because highly polarized political climates signify not merely political differences within a community, but increasing division, discord, and at extreme levels, incompatibility regarding the underlying moral values and worldviews that seek to influence both society and the state. Thus, as polarization rises, military actors increasingly encounter situations in which they must make judgments about whether to abide by the fundamental principles of civil-military relations, or to engage in acts of behavior that, while violating the central governing principles of civil-military relations, nonetheless advance a particular set of values that particular military leader supports. The extreme example of this in US history occurred on the eve of the Civil War, when scores of military officers decided to resign their commissions in the US Army and instead serve in the Confederate States Army. The act of resignation for the purposes of taking up arms against the Army in which one had just served is perhaps the epitome of a behavior that violates the principles of civil-military relations. And yet each who chose to resign had to weigh the decision to resign against other factors, including where he stood with respect to the issue of slavery.      

If American military officers could exist in a figurative and theoretical vacuum, polarization may not have the impact I claim it does. But the fact is that military officers are part of the American society that they serve. Before they join the military, military officers are young men and women who grow up somewhere. Like the rest of American society as a whole, military actors collectively become polarized as different worldviews and ideologies compete for supremacy in the political square. Furthermore, after joining the military, each military officer further develops his or her own worldview, and relies on certain moral values to help guide his or her behavior. When worldviews are increasingly at odds with each other to the point that they become incompatible --- which is the case when contestation is present over issues that squarely involve the image of God, as I argued earlier in this chapter --- military officers will encounter greater friction as they execute their routine duties. 

This friction has at least two sources. First, highly polarized environments increase the frequency with which military officers encounter situations in which they have to choose between supporting and obeying their civilian leaders or following the dictates of their own moral conscience. Rising polarization, in other words, ultimately leads to a problem of authority, and specifically, who or what is the highest authority that military officers will obey. Second, highly polarized environments increase the magnitude of the disparity that exists in these choices because the difference in outcomes (e.g., obeying and supporting a civilian leader or following one's conscience) is more likely to involve not merely a minor difference in political opinions, but a difference in worldviews, moral values, and the purposes that seek to influence American society. We can see both of these sources by examining those who resigned from the US Army on the eve of the Civil War and later joined the Confederate States Army. First, while these officers may have held views that were favorable towards slavery in some cases for many years prior to resigning, the issue of slavery and its extension became more pronounced and thus, more urgent, in the 1850s. Second, those who ultimately resigned likely eventually came to the realization at some point that there could be no middle ground. The choice they faced was to stay in the US Army and to take up arms against slavery and their home states, or to not (and for many, to instead join the ranks of the Confederate States Army). Indeed, the perceived difference in outcomes of this choice was significant. 

Thus, as polarization rises, some military officers will be willing to violate the principle of civilian control when they deem that the preferred policies held and promulgated by a particular civilian leader or administration are not simply politically unwise, but wrong in a moral sense. If rising polarization reflects differences about what moral values and worldviews are to govern the nation and society, then the definition of which orders or policies are immoral will increasingly depend on the worldview and moral values held by a particular military officer relative to those espoused and promulgated by a civilian leader.^[Furthermore, military doctrine regarding officership and ethics has long noted the immense role of morality in guiding the behavior and conduct of military officers. For example, Army Doctrinal Publication 6-22, entitled, _Leadership and the Profession_, states that, "The Army ethic has its origins in the philosophical heritage, theological and cultural traditions, and the historical legacy that frame our nation." See @united_states_army_adp_2019, 1-7, for more details.] 

In a similar vein, some military officers may be willing to violate the principle of non-partisanship if they believe that one of the major political parties possesses an agenda that is not simply wiser from a political perspective than the other party, but rather one which aligns to the moral views of the officer on a particular issue or set of issues. Finally, some military officers might be motivated to violate a standard of "non-interference" of the military into certain areas of state policy if they believe that the military should play a greater role in advancing the underlying ideology or values associated with a particular issue or set of issues.  

In summary, periods of heightened political polarization can create a _motive_ for the military to engage in behaviors that violate the central principles of civil-military relations because a high level of political polarization represents a battle over which worldviews will prevail, or conversely, which will lose sway. In period of relatively low polarization, this may not be a problem, but as I have argued, military officers will sense that more is at stake during periods of higher polarization. These same military officers may be trained to uphold the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference, but they are also part of American society, both before and after joining the military, thus developing their opinions and stances on the same political issues as do ordinary Americans. Thus, during periods of heightened polarization, an increasing number of military officers will also desire to behave in ways that violate the principles of civil-military relations. At some point, as polarization rises,  a military officer will prioritize the worldview and underlying ideology to which he or she subscribes over and above adherence to the central principles of civil-military relations. 

### The Military and Race in Contemporary America

Among the clearest contemporary examples of polarization providing a "motive" for military actors to engage in political behaviors which violate the principles of civil-military relations is the issue of race in America. For any observer or participant of American politics over the past several years, it comes as no surprise that the issue of race has become one of the most polarizing political issues in the United States.^[In many ways, and as the first case study describes, this is not an entirely new issue. The military has played a central role within issues that pertain to race, including desegregation of the Armed Forces.] The military, along with many other institutions, such as primary education, corporate America and business, and religious establishments such as the church, has been thrust into discussions involving race in America and what to do about it.  
At the risk of summarizing what is a topic that deserves a much fuller and lengthier treatment than can be given here, I will attempt to capture why the military and the issue of race have collided so drastically over the past few years, and to show how they have done so. In articulating this example, my aim is to demonstrate how the issue of race has served as a _motive_ for some military officers to engage in behaviors that violate, or at least challenge, the principles of civil-military relations. Furthermore, the key to understanding why this has been the case is in understanding that the events and discussions that have made race in America such a visible issue over the past several years have ignited different worldviews, values, and ideologies among military officers (like the nation itself) on the topic of race.  

Recent Pew Research public opinion data (2021) reveals just how split Americans are over the issue of race and what to do about it. Of Americans surveyed in July of 2021, 49% said that "a little" (34%) or "nothing at all" (15%) needs to be done "to ensure equal rights for all Americans regardless of their racial or ethnic background" [@pew_research_center_deep_2021]. In the same survey, however, 50% of those said that "a lot" needs to be done to advance the same [@pew_research_center_deep_2021]. Moreover, among the 50% who believe that "a lot" needs to be done to ensure equal rights for all, respondents were split with respect to whether current systems could accommodate the changes that needed to be made, or whether "most US laws/institutions need to be completely rebuilt" [@pew_research_center_deep_2021]. 

It is difficult to find any place, organization, or work space today that is not somehow impacted by discussions revolving around race. The military is no exception, and strong opinions abound whether these developments and the approaches that have been implemented to achieve racial harmony actually harm or help. What cannot be denied is that beliefs and convictions on the issue of race increasingly compel behavior that aligns with one's view on this topic (and other polarizing topics). For instance, in the wake of the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, 2020, multiple high ranking military officers penned opinion pieces that, while directly addressing President Trump's handling of protests across the United States, also more broadly revealed their own perspectives on race in the United States [@brooks_let_2020]. For example, Retired Admiral Mike Mullen, a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, penned an article in _The Atlantic_ shortly after these events occurred entitled, "I Cannot Remain Silent," in which he blasted President Trump's reported use of the National Guard to clear a path through Lafayette Square in order for the President to walk to nearby St. John's Church for a photo.^[In June of 2021, interestingly, the Inspector General of the US Department of the Interior issued a report in which he did not and could not corroborate any finding suggesting that Trump had given the order to use US Capitol Police to clear the park, and that the plan to clear the park had been in place for hours before Trump's walk from the Rose Garden to the church. See @montanaro_watchdog_2021 for more details.] In the article, however, Mullen further stated, "We must, as citizens, address head-on the issue of police brutality and sustained injustices against the African American community" [@mullen_i_2020]. 

This last sentence is clear evidence of Mullen's worldview, and it explains, at least in part, why he was willing to write an opinion piece that strongly and directly criticized a sitting President. The title itself, "I Cannot Remain Silent," describes how Mullen prioritized his worldview and his personal values over adhering to the principle of civilian control of the military, which likely would have resulted in either not writing the piece to begin with, or at least couching the piece in softer language that did not directly criticize the former President. To be clear, my aim here is neither to claim that Mullen was wrong for writing the piece, nor that he was right to do so, but rather to suggest that at a minimum, Mullen's personal decision to write the piece and to criticize the former President in the process flowed directly from his personal worldview regarding race in the United States and what should be done about it. 

The topic of race in America is likely to remain a motive for military officers to behave in ways that violate principles of civil-military relations for some time. More than a year after the death of George Floyd and the aftermath that followed, race in America remains a visibly hot topic, even in the military. Indeed, more than a year after Mullen's publication, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, appeared before Congress to answer questions regarding the military and its supposed stance on _Critical Race Theory_ (CRT). Critical Race Theory is something that most Americans had never heard of before 2020, but in recent months, debates about what Critical Race Theory is, and whether and how it should be implemented and applied in American institutions, have been extensive.^[I do not have the space to unpack CRT, or _Critical Theory_ in general, in this book, nor is that my goal. What is interesting, however, is the extent to which multiple institutions of nearly every flavor are debating, criticizing, or commenting on CRT. For example, evangelical churches are sharply divided over whether Critical Theory is even compatible with their religious doctrines. See, for instance, @allen_why_2020 and @baucham_fault_2021 and two evangelical leaders who offer strong warnings against the church adopting views on social justice that are compatible with _Critical Theory._ See also  @belkin_mask_2021 for an example of the role of CRT in school board battles ahead of the Virginia Gubernatorial Election, an election that many contemporary political observers interpreted as a resounding defeat of progressive education policies that aggressively implemented CRT. See also @saunders_behind_2021 for a confirmatory view, but also @saletan_what_2021 for a more nuanced view.] During the hearing, General Milley greatly angered Republican Members of Congress when he essentially stated that the military does not teach CRT, but that it remains a topic that should be learned and read about so as to better educate American military officers [@kurtzleben_joint_2021].

The bottom line is that the issue of race in America may serve as a motive for some military actors to engage in behaviors that challenge the governing standards of civil-military relations, depending on where a particular military officer stands with respect to the issue of race in America. Those who strongly believe that the lack of relative proportional minority representation among senior general and flag officers and among key occupations such as fighter pilots constitutes proof of a pernicious form of racism that still exists are more likely to behave in ways that affirm such a view. Other military actors who believe that the presence of these dynamics are the result of other underlying factors, such as selection of certain types of military roles that are correlated with race and socioeconomic background, are more likely to behave in ways that affirm these viewpoints [see, for instance, @dinick_race_2021]. 

Debates over these differing ideologies, worldviews, and things like CRT are not likely to remain merely philosophical or ethereal debates for members of the military. Indeed, differences over these particular issues impact how the military functions and operates. Consider the military's promotion system, and how different worldviews and ideologies lead different people to institute various policies. In June of 2020, Trump's Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, announced that the Department of Defense would remove all photographs of personnel as they are considered for promotion, in order "to ensure promotion boards and selection processes enable equal opportunity for all service members, promote diversity in our ranks, and are free from bias on race, ethnicity, gender, or national origin" [Mark Esper quoted in @schogol_dod_2020]. Such a policy is likely to please those who disagree with the assertions and goals of CRT, and who would affirm a _colorblind_ approach to combat racism. At the same time, such a policy is inherently against the assertions of proponents and advocates of CRT. Just a year later, some leaders in the Navy and Marine Corps announced that removing the photographs from promotion boards has hindered the Navy from achieving its goals with respect to diversity, and therefore, that the photos should be reinstated. For instance, Vice Admiral John Newell remarked at a panel on the topic of diversity in 2021, "I think we should consider reinstating photos in selection boards...we can show you where, as you look at diversity, it went down with photos removed" [Newell quoted in @toropin_navys_2021]. 

This example serves as just one timely and relevant example of how different ideologies can impact, and have impacted, the behavior of various military actors as their personal worldviews and moral values are thrust into the political spotlight.^[There are many examples of how different views regarding race have generated friction within the US military. One example involves a letter penned to the leaders of the United States Military Academy by several recent graduates alleging the systemic racism of West Point; see @askew_anti-racist_2020 for the original letter and more details. How one interprets this letter is largely a function of one's belief about the issue of race in the United States. See @dreher_wokeness_2020 for a right-of-center analysis of this letter and its implications.] The example of Admiral Mullen as a retired senior military officer blatantly criticizing a sitting US President shows how polarizing environments can lead to military officers behaving in ways that support the worldview, ideology, and moral values that they hold to, even as such behavior also violates one or more of the principles of civil-military relations. 

Does increasing polarization mean that civilian actors will also increasingly violate the central principles of civil-military relations? In my view, no, it does not. The main reason for this is that rising polarization by itself does not automatically denote that civilians will seek to employ the military in necessarily controversial ways, or in the pursuit of partisan ends related to highly polarizing issues. To be clear, there are numerous historical instances in which the military finds itself at or near the center of polarizing and controversial political issues. For example, the military played a major role during Reconstruction at the end of the Civil War, and the military has played a sizable role in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in modern times, which has certainly been a bitter and polarizing issue across the United States. These are both examples of the military finding itself at or near highly polarizing issues, in which case, I think it is reasonable to suspect that civilian actors might increasingly violate central principles of civil-military relations. But the military is not at the center of every polarizing topic. 

Pew Research Center polling conducted in 2020, for instance, found that among the most polarizing topics in the US today are climate change, gun control, the environment, and immigration [@pew_research_center_environmental_2020]. Other public opinion research has found that issues such as abortion are now more polarizing in the US than they have been in several decades [@blazina_key_2021]. The theory I have offered thus far affirms that members of the military, like the public, are strongly divided over all of these listed issue areas. But it is not necessarily the case that civilian leaders will use the military, directly or indirectly, to achieve their desired policy goals in each of these areas. For example, of those described above, only immigration and to a lesser degree, climate change, have directly intersected with the military. This is not to say that future gun control and environmental policies do not and will not impact the military, but rather that to date, these issues have not induced significant military action or involvement.^[Furthermore, one does not have to imagine scenarios that are too far flung to ascertain that significant civil-military strife could follow if the military were to be used in a greater way over any number of polarizing issues. Hypothetically, if a future President were to order active-duty forces to secure abortion clinics within the United States, there would likely be significant tension, if not between the President and military leaders, then at least among political parties and press outlets.] Thus, rising polarization weakens the constraining influence of the central principles of civil-military relations for military actors, but not necessarily for civilian actors.

### Prestige - An "Opportunity" to Challenge the Principles of Civil-Military Relations
\doublespace

Rising military prestige, on the other hand, offers an _opportunity_ for both civilian and military actors to engage in behaviors that violate the central principles of civil-military relations. This stems from the connection between rising prestige and its perceived influence on the _potential_ to impact public opinion. Note that for purposes of this theory, rising military prestige need only increase the _potential_ of the military to impact public opinion, not necessarily the _efficacy_ to actually do so.^[Scholarship has examined whether using the military, or specific military actors, actually can sway the public. The results are not conclusive. See @golby_military_2012 and @golby_listening_2013 for two such studies.]  

A significant amount of scholarship in the subject area of political communication describes how, why, and the extent to which elites can influence public opinion [for a sampling of this scholarship, see @saunders_no_2017; @guisinger_mapping_2017; @baum_relationships_2008; and @kertzer_bottom-up_2017]. Scholars differ on the degree to which elites actually impact public opinion; nonetheless, the literature shows that in general, the public looks to elites who are "knowledgeable" and "trustworthy" when thinking about which public voices to listen to [@lupia_democratic_1998, 69-76]. Scholars also claim that the more elites are perceived by the public to hold the attribute of credibility (broadly speaking), the greater capacity these elites have to "cue" public opinion [@zaller_nature_1992, 47].

Viewed through the lens of varying levels of military prestige, we can now project this scholarship onto the ability of trusted military elites (and perhaps the military institution in general) to impact public opinion. It is reasonable to consider that the more prestigious a military becomes, the more that military leaders will be considered to be "knowledgeable and trustworthy" [@lupia_democratic_1998, 69-76]. This is especially true if we conceptualize the second component of military prestige, its perceived level of skill or excellence, as the degree of public trust placed in the military (which I have argued, earlier in this chapter, is at least a reasonable proxy for military prestige). Thus, during periods in which military prestige is high, both civilian and military actors have an _opportunity_ to use the military to attempt to influence public opinion. 

We may certainly expect that civilian actors will be responsive to rising levels of military prestige. After all, a primary motivation of political actors is to remain in office [@strom_behavioral_1990]. Furthermore, previous scholarship extensively shows that leader credibility, in any number of domestic and international contexts, is important [@saunders_no_2017]. Thus, if and when civilian actors believe that engaging in behaviors that harness a prestigious military will improve their electoral chances, these civilians are more likely to engage in these behaviors, even if they violate one or more of the principles of civil-military relations in the process. 

There is also ample reason to suspect that military actors are responsive to rising levels of military prestige. If military actors know that they are increasingly valued, trusted, and esteemed by society, they may be more likely to behave in ways that violate one or more of the principles of civil-military relations. This could be because highly esteemed military actors believe that the public who values them will overlook or forgive such behavior, or that as a highly trusted and respected voice in the nation, they have an increasing duty to act as the saviors or guardians of the country [@finer_man_1962; @fitch_armed_1998, 129]. Regardless of the reasons for which it occurs, higher military prestige results in a greater likelihood that military actors may behave in ways that challenge the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference of the military. At first glance, the fact that civilians are responsive to high levels of military prestige seems to fit several instances in US history. Indeed, popular military figures have influenced public opinion in significant ways and in a variety of different periods. Generals Ulysses S. Grant and Dwight D. Eisenhower, for instance, were both wartime commanders who, largely as a result of the popularity they commanded with the public for an extended period of time in uniform, ultimately ascended to the Presidency [@teigen_why_2018]. 

In summary, high levels of military prestige present an _opportunity_ for civilian and military actors to use the military as an instrument to impact public opinion. This can result in both civilian and military actors engaging in behaviors that violate the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference of the military institution. These behaviors, as the examples listed below illustrate, can take a variety of forms.  

### Examples of Use of the Military to Sway Public Opinion

Instances of civilian and military actors using the military during periods of high military prestige to sway public opinion abound in US history. In the paragraphs below, I give two examples. The first involves the well-known instance of General Colin Powell who, as the sitting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in late 1992 - early 1993, wrote several opinion pieces as Bill Clinton assumed the presidency. These opinion pieces essentially argued that the military should not drastically intervene in the Balkans and other similar post-Cold War crises --- an effort to influence US national security policy. The second involves the use of retired military officers to speak at the 2016 Democratic and Republic political conventions, respectively. 

The first example illustrates an instance in which a high degree of personal prestige surrounding a single military actor facilitated that actor behaving in a way that violated the principle of civilian control. The second example illustrates an instance in which broader institutional military prestige facilitated behavior engaged in by both civilian actors (the political candidates and their campaign teams who sought military actors to speak on their behalf at each party's convention) and military actors (the retired military officers who agreed to speak), and which violated the principle of military non-partisanship. Both examples together are intended to illustrate how a high degree of military prestige -- either at the personal or institutional level -- provides an _opportunity_ for both military and civilian actors to engage in political behaviors that violate the central principles of civil-military relations. 

General Colin Powell, while still on active duty, wrote two major opinion commentary pieces in 1992 and 1993 that challenged Bill Clinton's views regarding the use of military force in the Balkans [@powell_opinion_1992; @powell_us_1992]. The timing of these pieces is important. Powell's editorial in the _New York Times_ was written just weeks before Election Day in 1992, and his _Foreign Affairs_ piece was published later that winter, right as Bill Clinton assumed the presidency. Perhaps Powell cleared the content of both pieces with the Bush Administration, which was still in charge when these opinion pieces were likely submitted for consideration. But what is important from the perspective of the three central principles of civil-military relations is that even if Powell did allow the Bush administration to review the content of his articles, Powell at a very minimum knew that airing his views in a public manner would generate political costs for Clinton, if elected. 

This is because the content of Powell's opinion pieces contradicted many foreign policy views held by Clinton and members of his cabinet. For instance, Powell's _New York Times_ editorial entitled, "Why Generals Get Nervous," explicitly stated that, "In Bosnia, there are no clear military goals," [@powell_opinion_1992] and his piece in _Foreign Affairs_ stated that a potential mission of sending US military forces lacked "clear and unambiguous objectives" [@powell_us_1992, 38]. On the other hand, Madeline Albright, Clinton's Ambassador to the United Nations and later, Secretary of State, felt more optimistic about the goals that American military forces could achieve in the Balkans and other trouble spots around the world. In a 2006 interview, Albright recalled the way in which Powell would frame military choices in rather stark terms for Clinton's foreign policy team. Albright recalls that, "On a regular basis Colin would come in and do a presentation...he’d go through this and say, 'We can take that hill and we can do that and we can do this. You know we have the best military in the world, but it’s going to take 500,000 men and $500 billion and 50 years.' So he’d lead you up the hill of possibilities and then drop you off the other side, and you’d end up with no options" [@albright_william_2006]. 

By the mid-1990s, Powell was no longer Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but by appealing to the American public through opinion commentary as Clinton came into office and by framing military options in excessively black and white terms for the new administration, Powell not only steered public opinion against the possibility of American military intervention in Bosnia, at least initially, but he also likely made the option increasingly unappealing to policymakers behind closed doors. Perhaps Powell's advice was wise and even accurate, at least in some respects. Yet his actions, I contend, also violated the fundamental principle of civilian control of the military in that it did not allow the Commander in Chief to genuinely consider and weigh a full range of possible policy options with which to respond to multiple developing crises in the world after the end of the Cold War.  

There is no "smoking gun" that explains Powell's behavior other than the fact that he felt strongly that the commitment of a large contingent of US military forces to Bosnia was a mistake. That said, for the purposes of the theory offered here, it is reasonable to conclude that Powell's actions were facilitated by the enormous degree of personal clout and prestige he carried. Powell was a charismatic, well spoken, educated, and likable figure who had become increasingly well known in the wake of the US victory over Iraq in the Gulf War. Powell likely believed that by engaging in the public behaviors that he did, a significant portion of the public would not only agree with his stance on military intervention in Bosnia, but be willing to either overlook or forgive any perceived breach of protocol insofar as military figures eschewing the political spotlight. In this way, Powell's high personal prestige afforded him an _opportunity_ to behave in the way that he did. 

A second and different example involves Army Lieutenant General Mike Flynn and Marine Corps General John Allen, each of whom, as retired officers, spoke at the respective Republican and Democratic Conventions in 2016. Regardless of what they said at the convention (Flynn is known for leading chants of "lock her up," referring to the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton), the act of speaking at an event that is inherently partisan violated the principle of non-partisanship of the military. In the aftermath of these conventions, Retired Army General Martin Dempsey, who had recently served as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, published an opinion-editorial piece in _The Washington Post_ in which he criticized both the retired officers and the candidates who had asked them to speak. Dempsey argued in his op-ed, "As generals, they have an obligation to uphold our apolitical traditions. They have just made the task of their successors –- who continue to serve in uniform and are accountable for our security -- more complicated. It was a mistake for them to participate as they did. _It was a mistake for our presidential candidates to ask them to do so_" [@dempsey_military_2016, emphasis mine; see also @exum_dangerous_2017]. 

In this example, the military institution's relatively high prestige likely provided an _opportunity_ for Flynn, Allen, and the civilian leaders who asked each of these generals to speak to violate the principle of military non-partisanship. Neither Flynn nor Allen were household names at the time, and it is doubtful that most Americans could identify either general's photograph today. It is more likely the case that each of the political candidates and their campaign organizers sought a military general's public endorsement because each believed that having a high ranking military voice would prove politically advantageous. Furthermore, both officers who agreed to speak also likely did so, at least in part, because each officer believed that he could influence public opinion and ultimately advance the political prospects of each candidate proceeding to the presidency. I am not suggesting that the high level of polarization that prevailed in 2016 was also not a factor in the officer agreeing to speak; indeed, the theory I have offered would instead affirm that high polarization played a large role in shaping and contributing to each officer's behavior. Rather, I am pointing out that first, it is highly unlikely that either general would have been asked to speak in the first place at either of these conventions had the military as an institution not commanded relatively high prestige at the time of the party conventions in 2016; and second, that each officer likely agreed to speak _at least in part_ because he believed he could impact public opinion, at least to some degree, because the institution with which each officer was primarily affiliated -- the military -- was highly prestigious.    

In summary, high military prestige reflects how important the military is to the nation and how esteemed it is by the public. The institution itself can be highly prestigious, but so can individuals, particularly among those who lead the institution. As military prestige rises, the _potential_ for the military to influence or sway public opinion rises. Therefore, civilian and military actors will increasingly engage in political behaviors in order to influence public opinion when the level of military prestige is high, even if doing so violates one or more of the central principles of civil-military relations. For emphasis, the theory advanced here is not concerned with whether high military prestige _actually_ translates into increased efficacy for the military or military actors to sway public opinion. Rather, I am simply arguing that when military prestige is high, civilian and military actors are more likely to believe the military can sway public opinion, and will therefore behave in ways that seek to do so. Viewed through this lens, rising military prestige thus provides an _opportunity_ for civilian and military actors to use the military to intervene in politics.

### Polarization and Prestige Generate Four Types of Domestic Structures
\doublespace

If high levels of polarization signify that military leaders possess a _motive_ to intervene in politics, and if high levels of military prestige afford both civilian and military leaders an _opportunity_ to use the military to engage in political behaviors, it then follows that a total of four broad types of domestic political structures that capture adherence to the fundamental principles of civil-military relations exist. These four structures are displayed in Table \@ref(tab:poss-environment). Given the presence or absence of _motives_ and _opportunities_, the simple typology below captures variation in each quadrant along two primary axes: the predominant type of actor inducing politicization by committing political behaviors (military or civilian) that violate the principles of civil-military relations, and the overall level (low, moderate, or high) of these acts. The final evaluation made in each quadrant stems from the combination of the axes, and offers a prediction for the overall potential for civil-military conflict (low, moderate, or significant) that exists under the domestic political conditions found in each quadrant. 

```{r poss-environment, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}

  "Low Prestige", "No politicization; low levels of political activity; low potential for civil-military conflict",

  "High Prestige", "Military and Civilian (induced) politicization; moderate levels of political activity; moderate potential for civil-military conflict", 
  "Comprehensive politicization; high levels of political activity; high potential for civil-military conflict"

### Low Polarization, Low Military Prestige

In this environment, military actors lack an ideological _motive_ to intervene in politics, and both civilian and military actors lack an _opportunity_ to harness the military in ways that seek to leverage public opinion. This leads to the theoretical expectation that while there might certainly be conflict between military and civilian leaders in this type of domestic environment, there will likely be neither widespread nor highly visible instances of political behavior committed by either military or civilian actors that greatly challenge or violate the fundamental standards or principles of civil-military relations. The political behaviors that occur in this environment do not generate significant civil-military tension. Historical examples in the United States of this domestic structure include the post-Vietnam (roughly 1973-1990) and immediate pre-World War Two (roughly 1936-1944) eras.

### High Polarization, Low Military Prestige

When polarization is high but military prestige is low, military actors genuinely possess a _motive_ to engage in political behaviors that threaten or violate the central principles of civil-military relations. However, as a result of the low level of military prestige that exists in this type of domestic structure, civilian and military actors lack the _opportunity_ to use the military in ways that leverage public opinion. This leads to the theoretical expectation that in this environment, military actors in particular will engage in political behaviors. Civilian actors in this environment are unlikely to induce political behavior involving the military. Furthermore, the overall level of political activity that occurs in such an environment accords with moderate potential for civil-military conflict. A historical example of this era includes the years between the end of American Reconstruction and the start of the Spanish American War (roughly 1877 - 1898).

### Low Polarization, High Military Prestige

In a domestic structure where polarization is low, but military prestige is high, military actors lack an ideological _motive_ to intervene politically. However, because military prestige is high, both civilian and military actors possess an _opportunity_ to use the military to leverage public opinion. This leads to the theoretical expectation that under these conditions, both actor types are likely to engage in visible political behaviors involving the military institution. Furthermore, because both sets of actors might seek to employ the military to influence public opinion, the potential for civil-military conflict in this domestic structure is moderate. 

Broad examples of this period include portions of the post-World War Two era until the end of the Vietnam War (roughly 1945-1973) and the post-Gulf War period (roughly 1991-2009). Several historical civil-military relations crises occurred under these conditions, including a major dispute between between President Truman and General Douglas MacArthur in 1951, another between General Matthew Ridgeway and President Eisenhower over the role of nuclear weapons and American's "New Look" policy, and yet another between President Bill Clinton and General Colin Powell in the early 1990s. 

### High Polarization, High Military Prestige

When polarization and military prestige are both high, military actors possess a _motive_ to intervene politically, _and_ both military and civilian actors possess an _opportunity_ to involve the military in ways that are intended to leverage public opinion. Under these conditions, military actors are increasingly willing to behave in ways that violate the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference. Furthermore, both military and civilian actors have an _opportunity_ to use the military to appeal to the public. This leads to the theoretical expectation that both actor types, military and civilian, will engage in highly visible political behaviors that challenge the principles of civil-military relations. Accordingly, there is high potential for civil-military conflict in this domestic structure. 

Examples of this period include the immediate post-US Civil War period during the start of American Reconstruction (roughly 1865-1868) as well as in the modern era (roughly 2010-2021). These conditions are also associated with a number of recent and historical civil-military relations disputes, including between President Andrew Johnson, General Ulysses S. Grant, and Congress for control of the military as an institution in the early years of American Reconstruction, and recent tension between the military under the leadership of President's Trump and Biden in the present day. 

Based on the theoretical predictions that follow from Table \@ref(tab:poss-environment), it is possible to derive the following five hypotheses, which will be tested in the remainder of the book: 

H1: Military actors increasingly violate the central principles of civil-military relations when polarization is high relative to periods of low polarization. 

H2: Military actors increasingly violate the central principles of civil-military relations in public and visible ways when military prestige is high relative to periods of low military prestige. 

H3: Civilian actors increasingly violate the central principles of civil-military relations when military prestige is high relative to periods of low military prestige. 

H4: Military and civilian actors engage in relatively more visible and public forms of political behavior that involve the military institution when military prestige is high relative to periods of low military prestige. 

H5: The most extreme levels of overall political activity occur in environments that are characterized by simultaneously high levels of political polarization and military prestige.  

## Section 3: Endogeneity and Alternate Explanations

This section highlights the extent to which endogeneity poses a concern for the theory offered thus far. Additionally, this section addresses several alternate explanations. In doing so, I explore what other factors -- instead of polarization and military prestige -- could be responsible for driving variation in the willingness of actors to adhere to the central principles of civil-military relations, and thus, variation in instances of political behaviors that threaten these principles. 

First, I address endogeneity. In doing so, I examine the degree to which the theory that I have thus far argued works the other way. That is, I ask if instead of polarization and military prestige driving variation in civilian and military political behaviors that threaten the principles of civil-military relations, is it possible that the behaviors themselves drive the levels of political polarization and military prestige? Second, I raise and discuss several factors that could serve as alternate explanations responsible for the level of political activity that violates the principles of civil-military relations. Ultimately, I conclude that concerns over endogeneity are present, but to a mild degree, and that such concerns greatly diminish (though they do not disappear) when the independent and dependent variables are strictly operationalized and defined. With respect to potential alternate explanations, I conclude that there are several other plausible factors, the greatest of which is norm change. Nonetheless, as I argue below, this (and other) potential alternate explanations do not significantly cast suspicion on the theory offered thus far.  

### Endogeneity Concerns 

As King, Keohane, and Verba (1994) note, endogeneity is a "common and serious problem" in the social sciences, especially in non-experimental settings [@king_designing_1994]. As this book relies entirely on observational and historical methods, rather than experimental methods, endogeneity poses a genuine concern that must be both acknowledged and dealt with. Endogeneity essentially involves the "direction" of causality, or how the variables that comprise a theory work in a sequence [@king_designing_1994]. While there are many different types of endogeneity, all forms generate concerns that the relationship between a particular set of independent variables and a dependent variable is not, in reality, what the researcher concludes it is [see Chapter 11 of @gerring_social_2012 for a description of different types of trouble that endogeneity poses]. 

Applying concerns about endogeneity to the theory that has been offered thus far in this chapter involves asking whether it is possible that instead of the levels of polarization and military prestige driving the political behaviors committed by civilian and military actors that challenge the principles of civil-military relations, which I have argued, is it possible that the behaviors committed by civilian or military actors which involve the military actually drive levels of polarization and military prestige in the society, and if so, to what degree? I address the potential relationship between political behaviors that involve the military and the levels of polarization and military prestige each in turn. Ultimately, I make two conclusions with respect to concerns over endogeneity. The first is that the degree of concern regarding endogeneity in the theory offered thus far exists at mild and manageable levels. The second is that the greater concern involves the potential impact of political behaviors involving the military on military prestige, rather than the impact on polarization. I briefly trace the logic in arriving at these conclusions in the paragraphs to follow. 

### Do Political Behaviors by the Military Drive Polarization?

I do not strongly suspect that specific acts of political behavior committed by either civilian or military actors that involve the military institution are likely to impact levels of polarization. This may seem surprising at first. After all, one can conceive of a situation in which the military acts in a highly controversial way, such as undertaking a coup, which elicits a strong response from a divided domestic public (for example, some parts of society might favor the coup, while others are opposed to it), and further contributes to the society becoming more divided politically and thus, more polarized.

However, a clear definition of what polarization is (and is not), and a clear operationalization of the concept, shows that such a relationship is unlikely. As I have argued in this chapter with emphasis, polarization is not merely a divided public, although it can certainly manifest itself as such. The heart of the concept of polarization, as I have defined it here, focuses instead on the societal divisions that stem from contestation over issues that involve the image of God, and how the image of God should guide and impact the moral values that guide the political community. Viewed through this lens, at least in the US context, it is highly unlikely that political acts involving the military institution actually cause or generate the division between worldviews or moral values that are prevalent. Rather, it is more likely that the division regarding which worldviews and moral ideologies that various citizens subscribe to and adopt already exists, as these issues arise from a much-deeper source --- the image of God, and by extension, an individual's beliefs about the fundamental purposes of life and the nature of the world. To be clear, I do not contest the notion that instances of political behavior -- by a military, or a government, or other institutions for that matter -- likely serve as a catalyst of sorts for bringing ideological tension within a society to the surface. Indeed, this not only seems plausible, but is almost certainly the case. 

In short, I contend that concerns about endogeneity, at least with respect to the relationship between polarization and political behavior involving the military, can be greatly reduced if these variables are narrowly defined and operationalized. In all instances throughout this book, rising polarization is broadly conceived of escalating tension between the worldviews and moral values that influence, govern, and prevail in society. Instances of the dependent variable, political behaviors that involve the military institution, are also very narrowly and precisely operationalized in the chapters that follow. In the quantitative empirical chapters in particular, instances of the dependent variable are systematically analyzed over time, allowing the researcher to more clearly identify variation and the causes behind it. In this way, endogeneity concerns between polarization and instances of political behavior involving the military are significantly reduced.

### Do Political Behaviors by the Military Drive Military Prestige?

The relationship between military prestige and instances of political behaviors involving the military requires careful examination. The theory presented in this chapter argued that rising military prestige provides civilian and military leaders with an _opportunity_ to engage in political behaviors that violate the principles of civil-military relations. With respect to endogeneity, then, we then must ask to what degree these types of political behaviors influence the prestige of the military.

Admittedly, it is theoretically plausible -- indeed, it is likely -- that certain political behaviors involving the military impact the prestige of the military. To begin with, the relatively high degree of military prestige is in no small way an ostensible consequence of the fact that the US military _does not_ regularly intervene in politics in significant ways. For example, we can rightly suspect that if the US military were to stage a coup and topple the duly elected government, the military's prestige would rapidly fall. In broad terms, then, there appears to be at least a theoretical possibility and likelihood that the relationship between military prestige and instances of political behavior might operate in both directions, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:overview-endog).

Importantly, however, this is likely not the case for every instance of a political behavior which involves the military institution. As this and the previous chapter made clear, the principle of civilian control of the military can be violated through a number of behaviors that vary in terms of severity and impact [see @croissant_beyond_2010; @brooks_paradoxes_2020; @brooks_crisis_2021; @beliakova_erosion_2021]. As this book focuses squarely on the case of the United States, it examines challenges to the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference that occur via visible but subtle behaviors. For instance, in terms of impact to the principle of civilian control, the behavior of a military officer writing an op-ed is not the same as undertaking a coup. Similarly, it is unlikely that every instance of a military officer giving an interview to the press impacts the broad level of military prestige in the country, unless, of course, a significant number or portion of these interviews violates the principles of civil-military relations that military and civilian leaders are expected to uphold. Careful operationalization of the dependent variable is critical to minimizing concerns about endogeneity. This is upheld throughout the book, I argue, and especially so in the two quantitative empirical chapters. The case studies (Chapters 5 and 6) also help clarify the sequence and order of the overall system of variables that are at play within the theory. 

In addition to specifically defining and operationalizing the dependent variable to the fullest extent possible, the intervening variable in the theory offered thus far significantly aids our understanding of the sequence in which the component parts of the theory work together. The previous chapter and this chapter argued that the levels of polarization and military prestige impact the political behavior undertaken by military and civilian actors by impacting an intervening variable --- the constraining influence of the central principles of civil-military relations. When the constraining influence of the central principles is high, both military and civilian actors generally behave in ways that adhere to the principles, but when the constraining influence is low, these actors behave in ways that violate these principles. With respect to concerns for endogeneity, what is important is that changes in the constraining influence drive actor behavior, and not the other way around, at least at the _individual/micro_ level. In other words, my argument is that actors behave in such a way that violates one or more of the principles of civil-military relations because they are less constrained by these principles, as a result of the motives and opportunities afforded by changing levels of polarization and military prestige. 

At the _group/macro_ level, I fully acknowledge, and indeed would expect -- at least to some degree -- that the converse could be true: one actor's behavior may influence another actor's willingness to abide by the principles of civil-military relations. For example, if a military officer views a superior officer behaving in such a way that violates one or more of the principles of civil-military relations, it is possible that the observing military officer of a lower rank may think that it is appropriate to behave in a similar way, and thus, he or she will feel less constrained to adhere to the foundational principles. But what is being described here, at least in my view, is not so much a concern about endogeneity in the theory, but rather an alternate explanation involving _norm change_. I tackle this very real concern in the section on alternate explanations, below.  

In summary, endogeneity poses a very real concern in this book, especially because this study heavily relies on analyzing observational data, rather than manipulable experimental methods. However, by carefully and clearly defining the independent, intervening, and dependent variables in this study, and by testing for endogeneity in the empirical chapters, concerns regarding endogeneity can be managed.  

### Alternate Explanations

In addition to polarization and military prestige, what other factors could impact the degree to which civilian and military actors commit behaviors that involve the military, and which violate the principles of civil-military relations? Furthermore, how can we test these competing claims? In the paragraphs below, I first identify two alternate explanations. These include the presence of conflict and/or type of threat environment, and norm change. Both of these alternate explanations are plausible in my view, and each offers various ways of testing these alternate claims. 

### Conflict and the Threat Environment

One alternate explanation for civilian and military leaders committing behaviors that challenge the principles of civil-military relations involves the presence of conflict or the overall threat environment. I link the presence of conflict and the threat environment together because of the relationship between these concepts, even though each likely functions differently in terms of impacting the political behavior of military and civilian leadership. It is plausible to think that when there is an ongoing conflict, such as a major war, military leaders are naturally less constrained to adhere to the fundamental principles of civil-military relations. While, to this author's knowledge, there is no formal theory explicating such a concept, one can reasonably see how when the lives of soldiers and troops are at stake, military leaders might be more willing to violate principles of civil-military relations. Indeed, one can argue that this was precisely the case when Colin Powell wrote the opinion pieces that he did in late 1992 and early 1993, just as Bill Clinton won the Presidency and assumed office [see @powell_opinion_1992; @powell_us_1992]. According to this alternate explanation, Powell's behavior stemmed not from partisan ideological differences, but rather differences about the use of force and the subsequent consequences of intervention in a certain way. 

Other scholars have argued that the threat environment directly shapes civil-military relations. For instance, Michael Desch (1999) argues that changes in the international security environment impact the relationship between civilian and military leaders [@desch_civilian_2001]. Desch argues when a nation faces a high external threat and when that country's internal threat is low, such an environment serves as the best possible posture for both sets of actors to maintain the principle of civilian of the control of the military [@desch_civilian_2001, 14]. There is some similarity between the variable of polarization and Desch's variable of internal threat level, but the variables are not exactly the same. Polarization, as I have conceptualized it, speaks much more to the degree of ideological difference that exists in a country, whereas internal threat level speaks more to how the military is postured for domestic use, and importantly, how such a posture impacts its ability to operate abroad [@desch_civilian_2001].

One might also contend here that victory or defeat in war would impact the degree to which military actors in particular shun the principles of civil-military relations. In particular, one can reasonably foresee scenarios in which defeated military officers engage in any number of political behaviors against a political administration that was perceived to have been against the military in some way, similar to some popular narratives regarding the Vietnam War [@mcmaster_dereliction_1997; see also @summers_strategy_1982]. One can also foresee an instance in which victorious military officers, fresh from success on the battlefield, engage in any number of political behaviors that challenge the principles of civil-military relations. These are real concerns. However, I conceive the variable of military prestige as having already captured the effects of defeat and/or victory on the battlefield. In other words, I think it is important to allow for the possibility that either victory or defeat (and many levels in between) can improve or lessen the military's overall prestige. Thus, I do not foresee including defeat or victory in war as an important control variable. 

Given the theoretical expectation that the presence of conflict and/or threat environment can shape the willingness with which the military in particular adheres to the principles of civil-military relations, it is important to control for whether the US is involved in an external conflict where possible throughout the book. This raises additional concerns, however, mainly involving the fact that much of the quantitative data examined in this book is recent, and covers the post-September 11, 2001 era. This could be problematic in that to a certain extent, this era is one in which the US military was continuously deployed, particularly in Iraq and, until recently, Afghanistan. Still, there are various ways to control for the presence of conflict, which I do when appropriate throughout the book. 

### Norm Change

A second type of alternate explanation is one of norm change. This alternate explanation starts from the viewpoint that the principles of civil-military relations themselves -- civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference -- are all behavioral norms that have been constructed by the civilian and military actors over time. This alternate viewpoint, moreover, would explain any sharp change in the political behaviors that defy these norms as a routine process of changing the accepted norms of behavior. Such a viewpoint would emphasize that whereas the accepted norms of behavior used to include binding prohibitions against obvious incursions that violate the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference, these principles are no longer held or deemed as inviolable by the civilian and military actors who practice civil-military relations. Norm change as an alternate explanation is consistent with a rich set of literature within international relations that builds out of the constructivist tradition, and which views various actors such as states [@wendt_anarchy_1992] and organizations [@finnimore_international_1998] who create norms that shape their behavior. 

Norm change stands as a plausible alternate explanation, but it possesses one major flaw that, in my view, renders the likelihood of norm change explaining changing levels in political activity that violate the standards of civil-military relations exceedingly small in the United States. This is particularly true from the perspective of military actors, and less so from that of civilian leaders. 

This flaw is found in the fact that virtually every single official document that aspirationally guides the behavior of military today emphatically states or implies the principles that have been derived thus far in this book. Army Doctrinal Publication 6-22, _Army Leadership and the Profession_, for instance, notes in its first few pages that the Army profession is "a trusted vocation of Soldiers and Army civilians whose collective expertise is the ethical design, generation, support, and application of landpower; serving under Civilian authority; and entrusted to defend the Constitution and the rights and interests of the American people" [@united_states_army_adp_2019, ix]. Similar language emphasizing the principle of civilian control is found in several other places throughout the document [see for instance @united_states_army_adp_2019, 1-6, 1-9 ]. Other documents, such as Department of Defense Directive 1344.10, dated February 19, 2008, prohibit service members from committing certain types of activities that violate the military's non-partisan ethic [@department_of_defense_political_2008]. It is clear that the military as an organization, then, has not reduced its commitment to upholding the central principles of civil-military relations.^[I also make this argument in the historical case studies, particularly in Chapter 5 regarding the post-US Civil War period. To be clear, norms against political involvement by military actors were not as strongly developed in the 1870s as they are today. I address this issue in Chapter 5. Directly comparing military behavior from the 1870s against that in the 1980s might not be a great comparison, but I do argue that the ways in which the independent variables impact the dependent variable operate the same in both periods. For this reason, the historical case studies are not only appropriate, but can greatly round out this study.]  

And yet, I do not deny that perhaps the organization's members no longer feel as bound as they perhaps once were to uphold these central principles. Indeed, a significant aspect of my book is acknowledgement of and explanation for this being the case. Perhaps some military (and civilian) actors commit behaviors simply because they see others engaging in similar behaviors more often. In this way, norm change as an alternate explanation is still plausible. However, because the organization itself is still rather committed to upholding the central principles of civil-military relations, norm change is not likely the major driver of any recent change in levels of political activity. 

## Section 4: Summary and Way Forward

This chapter developed a theory which argued that the two independent variables of political polarization and military prestige combine to impact the dependent variable --- specific instances, types, and patterns of political behavior involving the military by civilian and military actors. The theory also posited that the independent variables impact the dependent variable through an intervening variable, which is the constraining influence of the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference of the military. 

The theory argued in this chapter holds that high levels of polarization provide a motive for military actors to behave in ways that challenge or violate the standards of civil-military relations [@finer_man_1962]. This occurs, as argued herein, because increasing political polarization reflects disagreement in the populace not only about specific policy matters, but about the moral values and worldviews that should govern society, to what extent, and why. When polarization is high, military actors are increasingly willing to challenge civilian leaders, adopt positions that align with partisan entities and organizations, and advocate for the military to weigh in on or solve problems that are indirectly related to national security and defense. Military actors are increasingly willing to engage in these sorts of behaviors because doing so advances the worldview or moral values held by these actors.  

In addition, it is herein argued that high levels of military prestige provide both military and civilian actors with an opportunity to use the military to influence public opinion [@finer_man_1962]. High levels of military prestige reflect a military that is trusted and respected by the public, and both civilian and military actors are cognizant of this reality. For this reason, holding all else equal, a highly prestigious military has a greater potential of committing or being asked to commit (by civilian leaders) behaviors that violate one or more of the principles of civil-military relations. 

Finally, the theory contends that both polarization and prestige need to be considered in tandem to determine the relative level of political activity that will occur in domestic political environments marked by the presence or absence of high polarization and prestige. When both the motive and opportunity to commit behaviors that violate one or more of the principles of civil-military relations exist, the resulting environment with respect to the conduct of civil-military relations promises to be tense. When neither motive nor opportunity are present, the environment for the conduct of civil-military relations is not perfect but is likely more tranquil. When either a motive or opportunity exist, but not the other, distinctions with respect to the level of overall political activity and which actor commits these activities is less clear. The next four chapters of the book test the predictive power of the theory with intent to sharpen our understanding of each of these four potential domestic environments. We now pivot to the first empirical chapter of the book.
