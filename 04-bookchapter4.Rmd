# Chapter 4 - The Military in Campaign Ads

On October 10, 2020, then Presidential candidate Joe Biden's campaign team aired an advertisement narrated by a man identified as Jim, an "Iraq War Veteran." Jim, who also appears in the ad, describes the role and efforts of the former Senator and later, Vice President, Joe Biden, in delivering Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles to Iraq and Afghanistan. These vehicles were known for their heavy armor, which undoubtedly saved the lives and limbs of servicemen and women who were deployed at the time to the Middle East. 

The advertisement was later adjusted by the Biden Campaign after a retired Army Lieutenant General, Sean MacFarland, objected to the advertisement on the grounds that the ad also used images of him without his consent [@moore_biden_2020]. The images in question showed then Lieutenant General MacFarland -- in uniform -- shaking hands with Biden as the former Vice President arrived in Iraq [@moore_biden_2020]. In objecting to the ad, MacFarland stressed that he had not granted permission to the Biden Campaign to use images that featured the general in a recognizable and obvious way. Furthermore, MacFarland expressed concern that voters would assume that his appearance in the ad constituted an endorsement of Biden, noting that, "A number of people have understandably inferred that my appearance constitutes an endorsement of the former Vice President. It does not. To be clear, I have not endorsed President Trump, either. I object to the use of ANY military personnel in uniform in political ads -- full stop" [MacFarland quoted in @moore_biden_2020].^[The adjusted advertisement without MacFarland's image is available for viewing. See @joe_biden_mrap_2020.] 

This incident illustrates one of the many ways in which political candidates and interest groups use the military in political ways, especially during elections.^[President Trump's campaign likewise used military symbols and imagery in many advertisements. For a salient example in which the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appeared in one of Trump's advertisements, see @seligman_top_2020.] While civilians have long appealed to the public by harnessing the popularity of the military and of individual military figures in a variety of ways, the practice of doing so during a closely contested election season underscores how a non-partisan institution, such as the military, can find itself -- willingly, or in the case of MacFarland, unwillingly -- thrust into the political spotlight.   

This chapter explores the ways in which civilian actors have used the military during presidential campaign television advertisements. The military does not produce campaign ads --- civilian campaigns do. Therefore, examining the content of political advertisements enables a richer understanding of whether and to what degree civilian actors engage in a distinct political behavior that uses the military in ways that violate the principles of civil-military relations. 

This is an important endeavor, especially when viewed against the backdrop of the broader theory presented in chapter two of this book. While the previous chapter demonstrated moderate support for the notion that rising political polarization is associated with an increase in military actors behaving in ways that violate the principles of civil-military relations, the central concern in this chapter is whether variation exists in a behavior that is the purview of civilian actors. Using advanced statistical methods, the empirical analysis uncovered in this chapter likewise shows moderate support for the notion that increasing military prestige is in fact positively associated with an increase in civilian actors harnessing the military in ways that violate the principles of civil-military relations.      

This chapter proceeds in three parts, similar to the previous chapter. The first part presents the methodology and the data used in this chapter, which include nearly 7 million airings of more than 4,800 presidential campaign television advertisements spanning the six presidential elections from 2000-2020. In this first section, I defend the use of a proxy measurement for the variable of military prestige --- the veteran percentage of the population in the locales in which an advertisement is aired. The second part of the chapter presents and analyzes the data in depth. The third and final part of the chapter discusses alternate explanations of the statistical findings, and integrates the results of the previous chapter in an effort to set the scene ahead of chapter five.   
 
## A Brief Review of the Theory

The level of military prestige, I argued in Chapter 2, is one of two independent variables that shape the constraining influence of the three central principles of civil-military relations on the behavior of civilian and military actors. These three central principles include the principle of civilian control of the military, the principle of non-partisanship of the military institution, and the principle of non-interference of the military into certain realms of state politics. The other independent variable that impacts the political behavior of civilian or military actors is the level of political polarization, and was explored in depth in the previous chapter. 

The level of military prestige is important because higher levels of military prestige increase the _potential_ that the military be used, either by civilian or military actors, to impact public opinion. This central claim arose mainly from the political communication literature, which argues that the public often looks to elites who are considered or believed by the public to be "knowledgeable" and "trustworthy" [@lupia_democratic_1998, 69-76] when forming decisions or opinions [@zaller_nature_1992]. Chapter 2 noted that although this and other literature on elite communication [@saunders_no_2017; @guisinger_mapping_2017; @baum_relationships_2008] is not specifically written from the perspective of military leaders, applying this literature to the military, both as an institution and to individual military elites, is plausible. 

This is because, as the sociological literature regarding the stratification of professions instructs us, the variable of military prestige captures both the degree to which a profession is considered central or important as well as skilled or excellent at what it does [@davis_conceptual_1942; @jaco_prestige_1970]. When we apply this reasoning to the military, it is reasonable to conclude that the threat environment, for example, might shape the first component of military prestige; that is, a society that is constantly under threat or widely engaged in the world is likely to view its military as central to the state. On the other hand, war outcomes, such as defeat or victory in war, might also shape the prestige of the military, but through altering society's assessment of how skilled or competent the military is. 

Chapter 2 argued that when the public views its military as highly prestigious, the public is increasingly likely to view the military and its leaders as possessing the traits of knowledge and trustworthiness. Thus, as the prestige of the military rises, it is increasingly likely that the public may also listen to or become persuaded by the military and its leaders. This expectation directly led to the formulation of H2 and H3, which stated that military (H2) and civilian (H3) leaders increasingly violate the central principles of civil-military relations in public and visible ways when military prestige is high relative to periods of low military prestige. 

As noted in the theory, an important question then becomes what outcome or outcomes civilian and military actors are seeking to influence. While the answer to this question depends on contexts, we can expect that civilian leaders, whose goal is to stay in political power or to achieve their desired policy choices, become increasingly willing to violate one or more of the principles of civil-military relations, and therefore to engage in a political behavior or activity that does so.  

In summary, Chapter 2 argued that rising military prestige presents an _opportunity_ for civilian and military actors to use the military to sway the public. Depending on what policy outcomes or issues civilian and military actors seek to influence -- whether it is an election, or a use of force decision -- this can result in civilian and military leaders engaging in political behaviors that challenge the principles of civilian control, non-partisanship, and non-interference of the military institution. When civilian and military leaders believe that the military is highly prestigious and therefore capable of swaying the public, both actor types, on the whole, are less likely to adhere to and thus, be constrained by, the central principles of civil-military relations. 

## Methodology

Like Chapter 3, this chapter systematically investigates one distinct type of political behavior that is committed by one type of actor. The focus here is on the use of military imagery and actors in campaign advertisements by civilian political candidates. Accordingly, this chapter will evaluate H3 directly, and help inform H4 and H5. H4 stated that military and civilian actors engage in relatively more visible and public forms of political behavior that involve the military institution when military prestige is high relative to periods of low military prestige; H5 stated that the most extreme levels of overall political activity occur in environments that are characterized by simultaneously high levels of political polarization and military prestige. 

Theoretically, the civilian use of military imagery and actors in campaign advertisements closely resembles three types of behaviors discussed in Chapter 2 and noted in Table \@ref(tab:pol-behav-civ). The first and the closest is that of _Electoral Swaggering_, which I described as the use of military officers to attack or endorse political candidates running for office. The second behavior that the civilian use of military imagery and actors resembles is that of _The Military as Sales Reps_, which I defined as the use of military actors to garner support for civilian policies. The third type of behavior the civilian use of military imagery and actors in campaign advertisements most closely resembles is that of _Showcasing the Troops_, which I defined in Chapter 2 as the use of military symbols and images in commercials or printed material. 

In order to analyze this behavior, I examine all airings of presidential campaign advertisements on local television media markets (non-cable channels) in the five elections that occurred between 2000 and 2016, inclusively. This amounts to nearly 3,500 unique campaign ads aired more than 4.5 million times on more than 200 media markets in the United States. Media markets are essentially a grouping of geographic localities and are used, among other reasons, to help track where particular advertisements are run. From 2000-2016, the level of public trust in the military (from Gallup polling and defined as the percentage surveyed that has a "great deal or quite a lot" of trust in the military) ranges from 64 (in 2000) to 82 (in 2003 and 2009) [@noauthor_confidence_2020]. In the calendar years in which the general election campaigns occur, the lowest value is 64 (2000) and the highest is 75 (2004 and 2012), however. 

When we also factor in the credibility ratings of other predominant political institutions over the same period, a greater shift in what we might call "relative military prestige" becomes slightly more evident. For example, the gap between the percentage of Americans surveyed who expressed a "great deal or quite a lot" in the military compared to Congress was 40% (in favor of the military) in 2000 and 64% (also in favor of the military) in 2016. At the very least, the period from 2000 to 2016 generally saw relative increases in the prestige of the military. These increases are small when we consider trust in the military in its raw form, but larger when viewed in relative terms compared to Congress. 

Polarization over the same period also generally increased, except for measurements of affective polarization which show a dip in 2016 [@jeffrey_b_lewis_voteview_2020; @noauthor_american_nodate; @iyengar_affect_2012]. In short, the time period examined in this chapter, 2000-2016, broadly reflects movement between a domestic environment characterized by moderate polarization and moderate military prestige to one marked by higher polarization and higher military prestige. Because both of the independent variables change over the time period, the statistical analysis will attempt to disentangle the relative impacts of these (and other) variables. 

The level of trust Americans placed in Congress and the military, the level of relative prestige of the military, and the level of congressional polarization between 2000 and 2016 is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:trust-ch4).

### Veterans in the Population - A Proxy for the Variable of Military Prestige
\doublespace

However, some methodological challenges are presented in this chapter by the lack of significant variation in the raw level of military prestige, and by the fact that only five election cycles are examined in this chapter. I tackle these challenges in depth in a subsequent section of the chapter, but the greatest challenge should be addressed here and now. The greatest of methodological challenges, at least insofar as this dissertation's theory is concerned, is that the measure of military prestige used in the previous chapter, that of public trust in the military, is only measured on an annual basis. As there are five election cycles examined in this chapter, this means that across the data, there are only five different levels of public trust in the military, each corresponding to the year in which one of the elections takes place. This lack of variation makes it difficult to truly identify the role of changes in the level of military prestige generating potential variation in the data.

One way to handle this limitation, however, is to generate more variation by using a plausible proxy for military prestige, if such a strategy is possible. Fortunately, the data contain information regarding which media market, or geographic part of the country, an individual ad is aired in; with a little bit of work, it is possible to generate a measure of each media market's veteran population as a percentage of that market's total population. This measure provides an important methodological benefit in that it varies along the same dimension (media market) as the aired advertisements in the data. 

I generate this measure using population data from the US Census Bureau for each county, veteran population data by county from the Department of Veterans Affairs, and an unclassified mapping of media markets by county in the United States [@us_census_bureau_county_2010; @us_census_bureau_county_2020; @department_of_veterans_affairs_national_2019; @noauthor_2018-2019_2019]. I first calculate the percentage of each county that is a veteran, and then aggregate the county-level data to obtain the proportion of each media market's population that is a veteran of the Armed Forces. To be clear, this measurement is not perfect, and it does have some limitations. The most obvious of these is that the measure does not vary over time.^[For each county, I divide the raw number of veterans living in that county in 2018 as reported by the Veterans Affairs Administration by the Census Bureau's estimate of the county's total population in 2016.] Despite this limitation, this measurement is significant because it enables the researcher to investigate whether political candidates and parties target veteran-rich geographic areas of the country in any discernible ways.

### Is 'Percentage Veteran Population' A Sound Proxy for Military Prestige?
\doublespace

In order to consider the veteran percentage of a media market's population as a proxy measurement for the variable of military prestige, we have to carefully think how a measure associated with where veterans live corresponds to military prestige, if at all. At the outset, my claim in this chapter is not that I have answered why veterans choose to live where they do, nor that the possible answer I propose in the paragraphs to follow is the only answer, or even an empirically accurate claim. Rather, I offer here only a plausible and theoretically sound reason why veterans _may_ choose to live where they do, and to show how this plausible reason is connected to the variable of military prestige. 

It is first worth pointing out how other scholars have explored geographic variance in various military outcomes. Previous scholarship has tended to identify, rather than explain, the reasons for such variation. Savell and McMahon (2020), for instance, found that in per capita terms, troops serving during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2019 were not equally distributed across the 50 individual states of the US [@savell_numbers_2020]. As Figure \@ref(fig:per-cap-cas-state) shows, Savell and McMahon specifically found that the states of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Alaska, and Hawaii produced the highest proportion of their respective state's population of soldiers troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2019, while states such as Utah, Minnesota, Iowa, North and South Dakota, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Delaware produced the lowest [@savell_numbers_2020]. Though they are unable to determine _why_ populations from certain states seem to produce relatively more (and less) military recruits, their finding at least testifies to the fact that military service varies geographically. 

```{r per-cap-cas-state, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=4, fig.cap="Savell and McMahon (2020), Per Capita Troops Serving in Post-9/11 Wars, By State"}

include_graphics(here("data", "per-cap-cas.png"))

```

Still, we can and should think through why veterans might choose to live where they do after their time in service, even if that is not the main purpose of this chapter. It could be that veterans simply move back to their homes, or the place from which they joined the military. Yet even if this is the case, Savell and McMahon's work (2020), as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:per-cap-cas-state), shows that military enlistment is not geographically evenly distributed. There are numerous possible reasons, including economic opportunities, partisanship, or even military culture that might shape why certain states tend to produce more soldiers, as a portion of that state's population, than other states. 

It could also be that veterans seek to reside in areas of the country that offer distinct economic opportunities and benefits. Through this vein, it is important to consider, for example, that some states tax military retirement pay and others do not. For example, as of 2022, 26 of 50 states in the US do not tax military retirement income [@absher_5_2022]. A number of other states provide other tangible economic benefits for vets, including reduced college tuition and property tax benefits. 

It is also possible that some areas of the country offer veterans better opportunities to implement the skills learned during their time in service. For example, communities in and around large military installations might offer a number of potential job opportunities for veterans. Major military installations, such as large Army bases and naval shipyards, may offer veterans of these services a greater opportunity to hold jobs related to defense-related industries than other parts of the country. In addition, the communities in and around these major military installations may also attract veterans because they allow veterans to take advantage of several service-related benefits, such as the use of medical and other types of facilities, located on or near these installations. 

Viewed especially through the lens of economic benefits and opportunities, it is at least plausible that certain parts of the country attract veterans more so than other parts of the nation. If such a dynamic exists, it would not be an overstatement to suggest that the military is, in a very real sense, more prestigious in areas that attract veterans to live and work than in areas that do not. 

To see this linkage between veterans in the population and military prestige, recall that Chapter 2 of this dissertation pointed out that the concept of prestige consists of two related components, the first involving the _centrality_ or _importance_ of an occupation or profession, and the second involving the perceived _skill_ or _excellence_ of the members of a particular occupation or profession [@davis_conceptual_1942; @jaco_prestige_1970]. Especially through the lens of the first component of prestige relating to the _centrality_ or _importance_ of an occupation or profession, the military likely is seen and considered as more _central_ and _important_ by the local population compared to areas that have relatively little exposure to the military. And if these same areas happen to be markedly more attractive for veterans to live and work, it follows that a local area's portion of the population that is a veteran of the US Armed Forces is in fact a sound proxy for the variable of military prestige. 

Said differently, it is reasonable to speculate that the military is in fact more central -- and thus more prestigious -- in the areas surrounding Norfolk, VA than it is to those surrounding San Francisco, CA. I am aware of no available public opinion data that can prove this. However, if we consider that the military institution comprises a central part of the former area's economic base, so much so that one military online base guide says that in the state of Virginia, the area of "Hampton Roads - made up of the cities of Newport News, Hampton, Norfolk, Virginia Beach, and Chesapeake -- is the east coast epicenter of military activity," then using a measure of veterans in the population as a proxy for prestige seems plausible at the very least [@noauthor_hampton_nodate]. 

Figure \@ref(fig:vetpop-county) displays the density of veterans in the population by county in the United States. The national average for veterans as a percentage of county population in the United States is 7.3%. The main takeaway from Figure \@ref(fig:vetpop-county) is that there is intrastate variation in the density of veterans as a percentage of the population. This suggests, at the very least, that there are complex factors beyond those that vary at only the state level in shaping where veterans reside.

### Civilian Use of Military Imagery and Actors in Campaign Ads

Examining how civilians have featured the military in the content of campaign advertisements provides several advantages from a research perspective that are worth briefly articulating. The first is that there is no _a priori_ expectation that featuring a military image or a military actor in a presidential campaign advertisement must violate the principles of civil-military relations. More broadly, there is no expectation that civilian candidates would choose to feature the military in campaign advertisements over and above any other institution or entity. Civilian political candidates and their campaign teams have what appears to be a limitless array of options when producing campaign ads. 

A second significant advantage afforded by examining campaign advertisements is that they comprise an integral part of the democratic process. Like other democracies, the United States holds elections at fixed intervals; thus, we can expect campaign advertisements to regularly occur leading up to an election. We can and should also expect that the content of campaign ads will likely change over time, and for a variety of factors. The issues that are important to voters are not static, and the broad political atmosphere changes continuously. Of course, we would expect civilian political candidates and their campaign teams to construct advertisements around those issues and topics they think will be most effective in persuading the public to secure their electoral victory. At times, perhaps when wars are fought, for example, we might expect advertisements to feature the military in some noticeable way. While we cannot predict what specific issues will be on the docket four or eight years from now, we may suspect, if the theory offered earlier in this dissertation is accurate, that changes in the relative level of military prestige could impact the degree to which civilian candidates feature or showcase the military in the content of campaign advertisements. 

How might civilian actors fail to adhere to the central principles of civil-military relations through the content of campaign advertisements? It is unlikely that the content of a campaign advertisement would violate the principle of civilian control. This is because, as has been stated earlier in this dissertation, civilians have a responsibility to maintain and enforce the principle of civilian control, but they usually do not expressly violate the principle through acts of commission. Rather, such behavior tends to "erode" the principle of civilian control when civilians excessively defer to the military such that they can no longer adequately oversee the policy making process [@beliakova_erosion_2021]. Thus, a campaign advertisement that violates the principle of civilian control would have to take on a rather extreme form, such as one that featured a retired military actor urging others to mount a coup, or to stage some other act of obvious insubordination. 

While such advertisements are possible, it is far more likely that featuring the military in television campaign advertisements would break the other two central principles of civil-military relations --- the principles of non-partisanship and non-interference of the military. A violation of the principle of non-partisanship of the military vis-a-vis campaign advertisements would occur if an advertisement clearly intimated that the military favored or endorsed a particular candidate, or the policies or political stances of a candidate, or a particular political party over another. Such a message could and likely would communicate to the American public that the military (or certain military leaders, or a faction within the military) may favor a particular political entity over another. Examples of such behavior abound in almost every election, as this chapter will show. 

A violation of the principle of "non-interference" of the military into certain realms of state policy might occur if a campaign advertisement featured a military actor weighing in on policy arenas that are largely disconnected from national security, defense, and other essential roles the military is expected to fill in American society [@ben-meir_civil-military_1995]. Hypothetically, this could occur if a retired general appeared in a campaign advertisement and spoke predominantly about a candidate's plan to reform social security or to reduce the national debt, and why that candidate's plans to tackle these topics are better than another candidate's. In such an example, it would be reasonable to conclude that the advertisement violated the principle of non-interference because the retired military officer is likely not an expert on the topics of social security reform and the national debt. At issue then is the choice by the civilian candidate or campaign team to use a military figure to convince the American public of the candidate's merits on these particular topics. It is doubtful that retired generals, admirals, colonels, or captains are the most qualified experts to publicly evaluate the merits of various positions on issues that are largely disconnected from the topics these military officers are most familiar with, such as those related to veterans' issues and national security policies. Such an act would therefore violate the principle of non-interference.^[I do not question whether intelligent retired military officers can understand the topics of social security reform and reigning in the national debt. The issue at hand, however, is whether these actors, who are experts in other areas or sets of issues related to national defense, weigh in on topics that are far outside of the domain of their professional expertise.] 

### The Data

The data consist of 4,531,041 airings of 3,414 presidential campaign television advertisements featured during the five presidential elections held from 2000-2016, inclusively. The data are made available from the Wisconsin Advertising Project (WiscAD) and Wesleyan Media Project (WMP). For the 2000, 2004, and 2008 elections, the data come from the WiscAd, and consist of individual PDF documents that contain a full transcript and several still images of the advertisement [@goldstein_political_2002; @goldstein_presidential_2007; @goldstein_presidential_2011]. For 2012 and 2016 elections, the data comes from the WMP, and consists of full motion video, to include sound [@fowler_presidential_2017; @fowler_presidential_2020].^[See the Appendix for further details regarding how the data was cleaned and merged to enable a comparison over time.]

In the statistical analysis portion of this chapter, I also rely on data covering polarization, military prestige, and military casualties. For polarization data, I primarily rely on DW-Nominate (dynamic-weight, three step estimation) scores, which are constructed using roll-call voting data from the US House of Representatives and the US Senate [@lewis_voteview_nodate]. In some places, I also include affective polarization measurements, which are generally constructed using a series of "feeling thermometer" scores from the American National Election Study (ANES) [@iyengar_affect_2012; @iyengar_strengthening_2018; @iyengar_origins_2019].  

As a proxy for military prestige, I rely on Gallup public opinion data that captures the level of trust Americans have placed in the military and a variety of other institutions over the past several decades [@noauthor_confidence_2020]. I also use a variety of data sources from the Department of Defense to measure levels of hostile casualties sustained by US military forces over the past several decades.^[This variable is constructed from a number of sources, and consists of the number of hostile US casualties sustained in a given calendar year per 100,000 Active Duty military forces. I include in this measurement those casualties that are the result of what the Department of Defense classifies as either "hostile action" or a "terrorist attack." Annual data is provided from the Department of Defense from 1980-2010. I then used data from the Department of Defense regarding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to construct a measurement for years outside of this time range. The sources include @department_of_defense_dcas_2011; @department_of_defense_dcas_2021; @department_of_defense_dcas_2021-1; @department_of_defense_dcas_2021-2; @department_of_defense_dcas_2021-3; @department_of_defense_dcas_2021-4; @department_of_defense_dcas_2021-5; @department_of_defense_dmdc_2021.] Finally, using data from the Census Bureau and the Department of Veterans Affairs, I calculate the percentage of the population that is a veteran in each media market [@us_census_bureau_county_2010; @us_census_bureau_county_2020; @department_of_veterans_affairs_national_2019].

After gathering the data, I implement an empirical strategy that at its root looks to answer two major questions. The first queries how prevalent in each election were ads that featured military imagery. The second question seeks to answer how prevalent in each election were advertisements that violate the central principles of civil-military relations, and why these violations occurred.

In this portion of the chapter, I analyze the data and present the results. I first present a series of summary and descriptive statistics in order to provide a broad overview of the frequency and type of military imagery and partisan behaviors conducted by military actors that appear within the data. I then present the results of a detailed regression analysis to provide an explanation for the variation evident in the frequency of the use of military imagery and the conduct of partisan behaviors by military actors in campaign advertisements.

The raw data include a total of more than 4.7 million airings of presidential campaign advertisements from 2000-2016. Of these, there are matches of airings of advertisements to specific media markets for more than 4.5 million airings (96%), which include a total of 3,414 unique advertisements. After cleaning and merging the data across the five data sets, I capture several variables for each advertisement already coded by WiscAd and WMP that may prove useful for the statistical analysis conducted later in this chapter. These variables and a short description of each are displayed in Table \@ref(tab:existing-variables-ch4). 

```{r existing-variables-ch4, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

text_vars <- tribble(~"Variable Name", ~"Question", ~"Possible Values",
  "Air Date", "When was this advertisement aired?", "varies by airing",
  "Creative",  "What is the title of the ad?", "varies by each ad",
  "Media Market", "On what media market was this advertisement aired?", "varies by each ad",

Before viewing the advertisements, I develop several dichotomous variables that capture the types of military images and symbols used in these advertisements. The goal is to develop a taxonomy that is simple yet sufficiently wide so as to capture meaningful variation in the type of military symbols and images used in presidential campaign advertisements. Through a pilot coding of roughly ten percent of the total number of advertisements in the sample, I develop dichotomous indicators for the use of four types of military imagery and/or symbols: imagery of active-duty US soldiers or troops, imagery of veterans, imagery or scenes of combat, and imagery or scenes of US military hardware.

The first kind of military imagery, that of US soldiers or troops, include images of US servicemen and women who are in uniform. This type of military imagery might include a lone soldier in uniform saluting, or images of thousands of US servicemen and women training, or marching in formation. The key thing I look for are images of US military uniforms, military medals, or military insignia that clearly denote US troops. 

The second type of military imagery involves veterans. This indicator variable looks for any image of a veteran, which could include gatherings, such as an American Legion or Veterans of Foreign Wars group, imagery of a wounded veteran recovering in a hospital, or a wounded veteran in a wheelchair later in life with his or her family. Several advertisements aired by candidates who themselves are veterans feature such images, ostensibly to bolster these candidates' credentials with respect to veteran-related issues. 

A third type of military imagery involves images of combat. This variable looks for images such as an explosion related to a military conflict, a soldier driving a tank in combat, or any scene that is clearly intended to portray US soldiers fighting in conflict.^[This category does not include images of fighting that clearly involve non-US soldiers, such as those of a foreign military or members of a terrorist group.] The fourth indicator variable for type of military imagery accounts for images of US military hardware. This variable captures advertisements that contain images or scenes of any major military hardware item, such as a naval vessel, a fighter jet, an aircraft carrier, or military radar system. The key item of interest associated with this variable is something other than a veteran, an active-duty soldier, or a scene from combat that is nonetheless clearly related to the US military. I do allow for the possibility that an advertisement portrays or includes more than one type of military imagery. 

In addition to these four variables pertaining to types of military imagery, I develop four additional variables that measure several other items of interest --- including the overall purpose of the advertisement, whether the candidate is a veteran, whether the advertisement explicitly mentions or portrays that the featured candidate is a veteran, and whether the advertisement itself is entirely focused on military, defense, veteran, and/or or national security issues. These variables, the question they intend to answer, and the potential values these variables can take, are displayed in Table \@ref(tab:el-ads-additional-ch4).

```{r el-ads-additional-ch4, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

text_vars <- tribble(~"Variable Name", ~"Question", ~"Possible Values",
  "Act_Duty_Imagery", "Does the advertisement feature imagery of US troops in uniform?", "1 - Yes; 0 - No",

  "
  US_Mil_Hardware_Imagery", "Does the advertisement feature imagery of US military hardware (planes, tanks, helicopters, ships)?", "1 - Yes; 0 - No",
  "Combat_Imagery", "Does the advertisement feature images of past or present combat involving US military forces (prior wars, scenes of combat)?", "1 - Yes, 0 - No",
  "Def_Vet_Ad_Theme", "Is the ad itself focused entirely on military, defense, veteran, or national security issues?", "1 - Yes, military/defense/veteran issues only; 0 - other topics",
    "Ad_Purpose",  "What is the overall purpose of the ad", "1-promote or disparage candidates; 2 - promote/disparage a specific issue on the ballot, 3 - to discuss a general theme that does not do 1 or 2;  4 - other",
  "Can_Vet", "Is the candidate a Veteran?", "1 - Yes; 0 - No",
  "Can_Vet_Mention", "Does the ad explicitly state or portray the candidate as a Veteran?", "1 - Yes, 0 - No",
  "Vet_Fam", "Does the ad feature a Retired Military Elite, Veteran, or Veteran's family speaking?", "3 - Veteran and Family; 2 - Veteran's Family; 1 - Veteran; 0 - No",
  "Vet_Fam_Endorse", "Does the Military Figure explicitly endorse the candidate for office?", "1 - Yes; 0 - No; 99-N/A",
  "Vet_Fam_Attack", "Does the Military Figure explicitly attack or disparage other candidates running for office?", "1 - Yes; 0 - No; 99 - N/A",
  "Vet_Fam_Out_Issues", "Does the Military Figure address topics other than the candidate's personal characteristics or defense/veteran issues?", "1 - Yes, the military figure addresses topics outside of the candidate's characteristics and/or veterans/defense issues; 0 - No; 99 - N/A"

### Summary Statistics and Descriptive Data

This section presents the data in order to help the reader better understand patterns of variation contained herein. A total of six different angles are explored, each of which is intended to not only present the data in an interesting way, but also to identify plausible factors that might contribute to the patterns of variation shown in this section.  

### Defense-Themed Ads and the Use of Military Imagery in Campaign Ads

The first angle from which to observe the data involves the overall arc of US foreign policy over the period 2000-2016. Figure \@ref(fig:def-theme-mil-img) plots the proportion of each election cycle's advertisement airings that involve a clear defense or national security theme, that feature military imagery of any type, and feature military imagery in ads that do _not_ involve a clear defense or national security related theme.

While each of the three lines shown in Figure \@ref(fig:def-theme-mil-img) speaks to a slightly different factor, all three are indicative of how prevalent national defense and military issues are in campaign advertisements. Figure \@ref(fig:def-theme-mil-img) also depicts the red and green lines, which track the portion of defense themed ads aired and the portion of airings that feature military imagery of any kind, as following a very similar trajectory. 

One likely reason for the variation in the proportion of airings featuring ads that contain a national security theme and the portion of airings containing military imagery involves the prominence of issues pertaining to national security and the military over time. For example, the relatively low portion of defense themed ad airings and airings featuring military imagery in the 2000 Election relative to 2004 and 2008 is not surprising. The September 11, 2001 attacks ushered in a distinct role for the military as the US conducted lengthy military operations, first in Afghanistan in 2001 and later in Iraq in 2003. 

```{r def-theme-mil-img, include=T, echo=F, warning=F, error=F, message=F, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Portion of Defense-Themed Ad Airings, Airings with Military Imagery, and Airings that Show Military Imagery in Non-Defense-Themed Ads Across Presidential TV Campaign Ads, 2000-2016"}

ch4_sum_stat1 <- ch4_airings_analysis %>% select(Elec_Cycle, creative, def_vet_ad_theme, mil_img) %>% 
  mutate(
  not_def_but_mil=if_else(
    (def_vet_ad_theme == 0 & mil_img == 1), 1, 0
  )) %>% group_by(Elec_Cycle) %>% summarize(
    mean_def_theme=mean(def_vet_ad_theme),
    mean_mil_img=mean(mil_img),
    mean_not_def_mil=mean(not_def_but_mil)
  ) %>% pivot_longer(mean_def_theme:mean_not_def_mil, names_to="statistic", values_to="proportion")

ch4_sum_stat1_plot <- ggplot(data=ch4_sum_stat1, aes(x=Elec_Cycle, y=proportion, color=statistic)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + labs(x="Election Cycle", y="Proportion of Airings") + scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(2000, 2016, 4)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0, .30, .05)) + scale_color_discrete(name="Defense Themed Ads\nand Military Imagery", breaks=c("mean_def_theme", "mean_mil_img", "mean_not_def_mil"), labels=c("Defense Themed\nAds", "Military Imagery\n(Any Type)", "Military Imagery in\nnon-Defense Themed Ads")) + theme(legend.position="bottom") + guides(color = guide_legend(ncol=2,nrow=2,byrow=TRUE))

ch4_sum_stat1_plot

```

It is also mostly unsurprising that that the relative portions of election cycle airings featuring military imagery in 2004 (24.8%) and 2008 (15.1%) remained somewhat high relative both to 2000 and 2012. The war in Iraq was indeed a major theme in the 2004 election, when the incumbent, George W. Bush, ran against the Democratic challenger, John Kerry --- a decorated combat veteran of the Vietnam War. Yet by the 2008 election, the surge of US military forces to Iraq, which had begun in 2007, had shown signs that it was at least helping to alleviate the high levels of sectarian violence in many parts of that country. Moreover, US casualties, after peaking in 2007, had also been declining steadily throughout 2008 [@us_department_of_defense_dcas_2021]. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were not over by 2008, though they appear to have taken on less prominence as a campaign issue in 2008 --- a development that may also coincide with the fact that President George W. Bush was ending his second term in office.  

However, the arc of US foreign policy becomes a bit more convoluted from 2008 to 2016. First, from 2008 to 2012, the U.S.' involvement in Iraq formally ended (for a time), but its involvement in Afghanistan increased. In 2009, then President Obama ordered a surge of US forces to Afghanistan. Though the surge to Afghanistan did not result in significant progress, there were nonetheless important victories along the way -- perhaps none so critical as the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden, the architect of the 9/11 attacks. Additionally, the number of US casualties in Afghanistan peaked in the summer of 2011, and declined afterwards, especially in the months leading up to the 2012 election [@us_department_of_defense_dcas_2021-1]. Thus, at the time of the presidential election in November 2012, few observers could point to Afghanistan and say that the surge of forces there had been a complete failure; yet at the same time, there was little if any public appetite to do anything substantially greater there involving US combat forces. The relatively low portion of airings that featured defense-themed advertisements and military imagery during the 2012 Election Cycle is therefore unsurprising. 

However, in the 2016 election, the percentage of defense-themed ads and airings featuring military imagery rose sharply. Defense policy appears to have taken on greater prominence as an election issue in 2016 than in 2012 --- perhaps because by 2016, the passage of time had facilitated an opportunity for Americans to view the trajectory of US foreign and national security policy in critical terms and thus evaluate US involvement in a series of messy situations and crises that had unfolded in the Middle East and Eastern Europe since the 2012 election. These included conflicts in Libya and an increasingly deteriorating civil war in Syria. In particular, President Obama's handling of events in Syria in 2013, which included making but failing to enforce a now infamous "red line" in the event that the Syrian Assad regime used chemical weapons (which Assad did), troubled many Americans [@rhodes_inside_2018].

In many respects, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate for president in 2016, was largely seen as an extension of Barack Obama, particularly in the realm of foreign policy. Clinton had served as Obama's Secretary of State, and she was portrayed extremely negatively after a US Ambassador and three other Americans were killed on September 12, 2012, when terrorists attacked the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya [@bixby_parents_2016]. Donald Trump, an outside candidate who ultimately won as a Republican, ran instead on a platform of putting "America First," which included promises to cease fighting endless wars and significantly rebuild the US military. The combination of perceived foreign policy missteps between 2012 and 2016 and the promise of fortifying the U.S.' strategic position likely led to the relative increase in the proportion of ad airings that featured defense, veteran, or security-themed ads. 

At any rate, Figure \@ref(fig:def-theme-mil-img) clearly shows that the prominence of national security-themed advertisements and those featuring military imagery in recent presidential elections waxes and wanes. It is also important to briefly comment on what the blue line in Figure \@ref(fig:def-theme-mil-img) conveys. This line plots the portion of airings in each election cycle showing military imagery in advertisements that are not of a defense or national security theme. In practice, these are ads which show some type of military image or picture -- whether a soldier or sailor, veteran, image of combat, or piece of military hardware, in an advertisement that is _not_ of a defense-related theme. This line matters because it conveys one sense of the degree to which candidates want viewers to know they care about the military by showing military imagery in ads that are not exclusively focused on the military or defense related issues. It is noteworthy that there are ebbs and flows in this blue line shown in Figure \@ref(fig:def-theme-mil-img), but less variation than is reflected in the red and green lines. This may suggest that parties and candidates in recent presidential elections have at least some baseline level of conveying their support for the military to the public.  

### Military Imagery in Presidential Advertisements by Type

A second angle from which to observe the data is the type of military imagery featured in campaign advertisements over time. Figure \@ref(fig:img-type-prop-ch4) depicts the type of military imagery featured in election advertisements as the proportion of total advertisement airings from 2000-2016. Similar to the previous figure, variation is evident, and the largest spikes in the data occur in 2004 and in 2016. 

```{r img-type-prop-ch4, include=T, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=F, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Proportion of Presidential Campaign Ad Airings Displaying Military Imagery, by Type of Imagery"}

# calculate the proportion of airings by type of imagery
airings_img_type <- ch4_airings_analysis %>% select(Elec_Cycle, creative, act_dty_img, vet_img, us_mil_hard_img, us_cmbt_img) %>% group_by(Elec_Cycle) %>% summarise(
  mean_act_dty_img = mean(act_dty_img),
  mean_vet_img = mean(vet_img),
  mean_hard_img = mean(us_mil_hard_img),
  mean_cmbt_img = mean(us_cmbt_img)
) 
# use pivot longer function to make data graphable
airings_img_type<- airings_img_type %>% pivot_longer(mean_act_dty_img:mean_cmbt_img, names_to = "statistic", values_to = "Proportion")
# make the plot
airings_img_type_plot <- ggplot(data=airings_img_type, aes(x=Elec_Cycle, y=Proportion, color=statistic)) + geom_point() + geom_line() +  labs(x="Election Cycle", y="Proportion of Airings") + scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(2000, 2016, 4)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0, .25, .05)) + scale_color_discrete(name="Imagery Type", breaks=c("mean_act_dty_img", "mean_vet_img", "mean_hard_img", "mean_cmbt_img"), labels=c("Active Military", "Veteran", "Mil.Hardware", "Combat")) + theme(legend.position="bottom") + guides(color = guide_legend(ncol=2,nrow=2,byrow=TRUE))

airings_img_type_plot
```

In 2000, 2004, and 2008, active-duty troop imagery was the most commonly aired type of military imagery; but in 2012 and 2016, this pattern changed. In these election cycles, veteran imagery was the most common type of military imagery portrayed to the American public in presidential election campaigns. This could reflect a relative increase in the growing number of veterans in the population, especially as the duration of the Iraq and Afghanistan campaigns increased. Additionally, combat imagery went from the second least likely to the least likely form of military imagery to be shown in 2012, a pattern that also held in 2016. This may also reflect the fact that the active combat occurring in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had become less pronounced relative to other issues, domestic and international, during the later election cycles examined in the data. 

\singlespace
### The Use of Military Imagery in Primary and General Presidential Campaign Seasons
\doublespace

A third angle from which to view the data involves the prominence of military imagery during the primary versus the general campaign portions of each election cycle. Figure \@ref(fig:mil-img-by-election-type) depicts the proportion of advertisement airings in each election cycle, split by primary versus general campaigns, that contain military imagery of any kind. Note that in all election cycles except for 2016, the portion of advertisement airings featuring military imagery during the primary campaigns was greater than that shown during the general campaign. Moreover, the gulf between the primary and general proportion of airings featuring military imagery was widest in 2000, 2004, and 2016, while in 2008 and 2012, this relative gulf between the proportion of such ad airings was smaller. 

```{r mil-img-by-election-type, include=T, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=F, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Proportion of Presidential Campaign Ad Airings Displaying Military Imagery, by Election Type (Primary and General)"}
## number of airings primary/general
#table(list(ch4_airings_analysis$eln_type))
#3,047,663 general elec airings
#1,483,378 primary airings

# calculate the proportion of primary vs. general election airings, by election cycle, that show military imagery
airings_img_type_election <- ch4_airings_analysis %>% select(Elec_Cycle, eln_type, creative, mil_img) %>% group_by(Elec_Cycle, eln_type) %>% summarise(
  mean_mil_img = mean(mil_img)
)
# turn graphable data into plot
airings_img_type_election_plot <- ggplot(data=airings_img_type_election, aes(x=Elec_Cycle, y=mean_mil_img, color=eln_type)) + geom_point(size=2) + labs(x="Election Cycle", y="Proportion of Airings\n Featuring Military Imagery") + scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(2000, 2016, 4)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0, .35, .05)) + scale_color_discrete(name="Election Type", breaks=c("PRIMARY", "GEN_ELEC"), labels=c("Primary", "General")) + theme(legend.position="bottom") + geom_line()

airings_img_type_election_plot
```

It is difficult to conclusively state why the primary campaign might generate different portions of advertisement airings containing military imagery than the general campaign afterward. More candidates are competing for each party's nomination during the primary campaign, and perhaps many of these initial candidates lack international experience. It is likely that either to draw attention to other candidates' lack of international experience or to tout their own, candidates who do have international politics experience might attempt to leverage this imbalance to their advantage in the primary campaign by discussing issues with which they are more familiar. It follows, then, that advertisements aired during the primary campaign would also reflect such a dynamic. 

The underlying reasons might be much simpler, however. It could be, for instance, that within four of the five election cycles examined in this chapter, the primary campaign season simply overlapped with more significant international political dynamics than during the general campaigns. For example, the primary campaign season during the 2004 election started the previous year, in 2003, when the Iraq War began. Perhaps the candidates running in the 2004 Democratic primary campaign simply had to talk more about the Iraq War -- and air more ads featuring military imagery -- because as an issue, the Iraq War held more significant prominence than a year later, in the fall of 2004. These possibilities deserve further exploration; however, it is interesting that, at the very minimum, four of the five election cycles saw primary campaigns featuring relatively more military imagery than the corresponding general campaign.

### Are Campaign Ads Increasingly Challenging Principles of Civil-Military Relations?
\doublespace

The fourth, fifth, and sixth angles through which to examine the data involve a slight pivot, and instead examine whether and to what degree presidential campaign advertisements more clearly violate one or more of the principles of civil-military relations. Here the focus becomes not solely the presence of military images and symbols in advertisements, but also the appearance and behaviors of military actors who appear prominently in campaign advertisements. By this, I refer to instances that describe a number of potential circumstances; but the thrust of the idea involves someone who is related to the military in some way -- a military figure -- that appears in a distinguishable, identifiable, and deliberate manner in an advertisement.

This includes, for instance, a retired military officer appearing by name to endorse a particular candidate for office, or it might include the presentation of a photograph and name of a military actor on the screen, informing the viewer that the particular military actor has endorsed a candidate running for office. It may also include a veteran narrating an advertisement and identifying himself or herself as such. Other scenarios might include the family member(s) of a soldier killed or wounded in action being identified as such and appearing in an advertisement. 

We must also examine what behaviors, if any, military figures who appear prominently in campaign ads exhibit, as their actions and behaviors are more discernible expressions that may violate the principles of civil-military relations than the use of military imagery in campaign ads alone. It is much clearer, for example, for a researcher to determine if a prominent military figure has verbally endorsed or attacked a political candidate during an advertisement, rather than attempting to determine if the presence of an image of a tank or aircraft carrier violates one or more of the principles of civil-military relations. 

Therefore, I create three dichotomous indicator variables that each capture a behavior denoting a violation of the principles of civil-military relations. First, I capture violations of the military's non-partisanship principle by cataloging instances of a military figure explicitly endorsing a political candidate for office. This type of violation is fairly straightforward. I watch or read the transcript of the ads (in the cases of 2000, 2004, and 2008) and catalog explicit endorsements of candidates made by military figures. Second, I capture instances of military figures attacking a political candidate during the course of a campaign advertisement. This behavior is also a violation of the principle of non-partisanship, as an attack on a candidate portrays the military figure making the attack as being no longer neutral toward all candidates during an election.  

The final indicator variable captures instances in which a military figure addresses issues that fall outside of the figure's relevant military expertise. Such an act denotes a violation of the principle of military non-interference. This type of violation is not as straightforward as the first two, as it requires determining whether the military figure possesses relevant knowledge or expertise regarding a certain topic, or might reasonably serve as a spokesperson for that issue area. For example, if a veteran who appears in an advertisement discusses why a particular candidate's plan for improving social security is better than another candidate's, I count this as a violation of the principle of non-interference. On the other hand, if a deceased veteran's mother or father makes a comment about a candidate's plan for taking care of the nation's veterans, I do not code this as a violation of the principle of non-interference.^[Similar to identifying violations to this principle in the previous chapter, I try to be both reasonable and charitable. I code for instances in which there is a gross mismatch between the military figure and whatever topic he or she is addressing.] I also allow for the possibility that an advertisement may feature a military figure who engages in all three behaviors (endorse, attack, and address an outside topic).

### Prominent Military Figures Appearances by Political Party

The fourth descriptive statistic is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ch4-viol-overview). It plots the proportion of each major political party's advertisement airings by election cycle in which a prominent military figure appears with any of the three violations described above.

Two points are noteworthy. First, it is clear that, especially among 2004 ad airings sponsored by Democrats, there is a discernible difference between the portion of ads featuring a prominent appearance by a military figure and the portion featuring these figures engaging in one or more violations of the principles of civil-military relations. This simply means that in 2004 (and to a lesser degree in 2008 and among Republicans in 2012), there were military figures who appeared prominently in campaign ads but did not violate the principles of civil-military relations. 

In 2016 (for both parties) and during 2008 and 2012 (for Democrats), there was no difference between prominent appearances and violations of the principles of civil-military relations by military figures in campaign ads. That is, during these election cycles, prominent appearances of military figures _always_ correspond to the same figures violating the principles of civil-military relations. 

The second noteworthy item of interest from Figure \@ref(fig:ch4-viol-overview) is the obvious and giant spike in the data during the 2004 election cycle, when the Democratic and Republican Parties aired a relatively high portion of advertisements that featured military actors who appeared prominently. This dynamic deserves some explanation about the 2004 election itself.  

During the 2004 presidential campaign, a number of veterans, family members of veterans, and retired officers coalesced to attack the war record of the Democratic candidate, Senator John Kerry. The group, which became an official political action committee known as the "Swift Boat Veterans for Truth," claimed that Kerry had exaggerated his war record and was undeserving of many of the heroic medals he had received [@ullman_whats_2008]. The group even published a book that turned out to be a _New York Times_ bestseller, whose title embodied the group's main charge against Kerry: "Unfit for Command" [@buckaloo_swiftboat_nodate]. 

Although it is hard to state conclusively, the attacks levied by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth against Kerry were almost certainly effective and likely damaged his chances of winning the presidency. One scholar argues that the attack ads levied by the Swift Boat Veterans were effective because they featured real veterans as opposed to paid actors, thus lending a plausible semblance of veracity to their claims, and because the group perfectly timed the release of their ads to coincide with the "doldrums period between conventions," thus facilitating the ads garnering significant media exposure [@devlin_contrasts_2005, 292].^[It is not my central purpose to render a normative judgement on the actions or the intent of the Swift Boat Veterans. One can reasonably conclude that their behavior was inherently partisan, for the actions of the group apparently contributed, at least in part, to the prevention of Kerry ascending to the presidency. From this perspective, the actions of the Swift Boat Veterans must be viewed as wrong in that they violated the military's non-partisan ethic. On the other hand, one may take a different view of the actions of the Swift Boat Veterans. This alternate view emphasizes the fact that the Swift Boat Veterans began as an organic veterans group, and thus was not the brainchild or the creation of a political party. The group's founder, retired Admiral Roy Hoffman, insists that his actions were sparked only upon reading Douglas Brinkley's biography of Kerry, _Tour of Duty_, and gaining the impression that the book had significantly embellished Kerry's war record by making claims that were not true. Ultimately, many of Kerry's fellow veterans supported and backed Kerry, while others did not. See @rosin_unfriendly_2004 for a narrative of the beginning of the Swift Boat Veterans organization and @devlin_contrasts_2005 for a description of the group's activities.] 

### Violations of Civil-Military Principles by Type

A fifth angle from which to view the data is plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:ch4-viol-type), which displays the proportion of ads aired in each election cycle that feature a specific type of violation to the principles of civil-military relations. The figure clearly shows the uniqueness of the 2004 election, but also the distinctiveness of the 2016 election. In 2016, for instance, which occurred amid a highly polarized political environment, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump competed for the presidency. Moreover, violations of the central principles of civil-military relations in the 2016 election by military figures who appeared prominently in campaign advertisements appears to have been driven by attacks of the presidential candidates. It is also clear, however, that the 2016 election generated an increase in the portion of ad airings in which military figures both endorsed candidates running for office and addressed topics outside of their own military expertise. 

```{r ch4-viol-type, include=T, echo=F, warning=F, error=F, message=F, fig.cap="Proportion of Campaign Ad Airings Featuring Attacks, Endorsements, and Addressing Outside Topics by Military Figures"}
# prep the data for the plot of violation types

### Do Political Ads Containing Military Imagery Target Veterans?

The final angle from which to view the data involves the veteran population of each media market. Earlier in this dissertation, I defended the use of this indicator as at least a theoretically plausible proxy for the variable of military prestige. 

Table \@ref(tab:ch4-stats-vet-pop) displays the summary statistics for the percentage of the veteran population across the 211 distinct media markets represented in the data. 

```{r ch4-stats-vet-pop, include=T, echo=F, error=F, warning=F, message=F}
ch4_vetpop_stats <- tribble(~Variable, ~Min, ~Max, ~Mean, ~SD, ~N,
   'Percent Veteran Population', 2.08, 13.4, 7.2, 1.7, 211)

ch4_vetpop_tab <- kable(ch4_vetpop_stats, 
            format = 'simple', 
            booktabs = TRUE, 
            caption = "Percentage of Media Market Population that is a Veteran",
            align = c('l', 'c', 'c', 'c'),
            digits = 2)

ch4_vetpop_tab
```

Furthermore, Table \@ref(tab:top-bottom-vet-mkts) shows the top and bottom five ranked ranked media markets by veteran percentage of the population in the data. The far right column also shows how many total presidential campaign ads aired in each of these media markets. 

\singlespace

Additionally, Figure \@ref(fig:vetpop-DMA) displays the density of veterans as a percentage of each media market in the US. The top and bottom five media markets are labeled, and correspond to the ten markets shown in Table \@ref(tab:top-bottom-vet-mkts).

```{r vetpop-DMA-prep, include=F, echo=F, warning=F, error=F, message=F}

Moreover, of the 211 different media markets that appear in the data, there are 64 that appear in all five election cycles. For these 64 markets only, Figure \@ref(fig:ch4-vetpop-mkt) depicts a series of plots where the x-axis is the percentage of veterans in the population of these markets. The y-axis in each of these plots is the portion of that market's total airings of presidential advertisements that feature military imagery, contain military figure appearances, or show military figures engaging in explicit acts that violate the principles of civil-military relations. For each plot shown, a simple line of best fit, in blue, is also shown.

```

At first glance, there appears to be at least a positive relationship between a media market's veteran density and several important indicators, including the proportion of political advertisements aired that display several types of military imagery. The relationship also appears to be positive for military figure prominent appearances and military figure attacks. The relationship appears to be less obvious for military figure endorsements and military figures addressing outside issues. In any case, Figure \@ref(fig:ch4-vetpop-mkt) suggests that the veteran population in each media market may in fact play a role in determining whether and how frequently military themed imagery or military actors are shown in campaign ads. 

### Summary of Descriptive Statistics

The presentation of descriptive data suggests that several factors might contribute to the variation we see in how political parties and candidates use military imagery and military actors in political advertisements. These factors include the general rise and fall of defense and national security issues and matters pertaining to foreign policy relative to domestic political issues, potential differences in the role of primary versus general election campaign seasons, partisanship, and the veteran percentage of the population in the geographic locales where advertisements are aired. The next section of the chapter presents the results of a regression analysis that seeks to explain variation in the ways that political parties and candidates harness the military, and military actors in particular, in campaign advertisements.

### Explaining Campaign Ads that Feature Explicitly Partisan Behavior by Military Figures
\doublespace

Before presenting the results, it is important to discuss one major methodological challenge the data examined in this chapter present. I alluded to this challenge earlier, but discuss it here in greater detail.

This challenge stems from the fact that the data come from only five election cycles. Furthermore, the elections themselves occur precisely at four year intervals. This is a challenge insofar as several of the independent variables I am interested in are measured in such a way that perfectly corresponds to the year in which an election is held. In other words, many independent variables, such as polarization and the level of hostile casualties endured by US forces, perfectly covary with time. In addition to employing a cross-sectional proxy measure for military prestige, I tackle this very real challenge by including fixed effects that correspond to the election cycle and campaign season (primary versus general campaign). This approach has both its advantages and disadvantages. 

Positively, the advantage of including election cycle-campaign season fixed effects instead of the variables that covary perfectly over time is that these fixed effects control for any other omitted variables that might be missing. This enables the researcher to isolate the variable of interest, which in this case is the percentage of veterans in the population of each media market --- the proxy measure for military prestige. The main disadvantage of including election cycle-campaign season fixed effects is the loss of the ability to truly identify and measure the influence of these other variables that do in fact vary perfectly over time. In other words, I cannot include election cycle-campaign season fixed effects _and_ variables such as polarization, casualty rate, and trust in the military in the same regression models.   

In the main body of this chapter, I include only the regression results that include election cycle-campaign season fixed effects. Where appropriate, I refer the reader to this chapter's appendix, where I include regression tables that discard fixed effects, and instead include the independent variables that vary perfectly over time together. I discuss any pertinent differences between these results and their implications here in the main text of the chapter. 

I conduct two different types of regression analyses. The first incorporates logistic (Logit) regression, and the second uses ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. To focus solely on the behavior of civilian actors, I drop all observations in the data aired by interest groups. This leaves only airings sponsored by political candidates, parties, or some combination of candidates and parties. The main difference between the logistic and OLS regression analyses is that the former allows for the inclusion of additional variables, whereas the latter does not. In both regression analyses presented, the baseline level of election cycle-campaign season fixed effects is the 2008 general election campaign. 

I describe and present the results of each type of regression analysis in turn. 

```{r ch4-reg-prep, include=T, echo=T, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}

### Logistic Regression

The unit of analysis in this section is the individual airing of an advertisement. After dropping airings of advertisements sponsored by interest groups, the remaining number of observations in the data is 3,530,061. In addition to including election cycle-campaign season fixed effects, I control for the percentage of veterans in the population of the media market in which the ad is aired. I also include a categorical control for the party of the candidate supported in the aired advertisement, and a dichotomous indicator for whether any of the candidates featured in the aired advertisement is a veteran. 

I control for the party sponsor of each advertisement to capture any potential inclination a political party has toward featuring military imagery and/or military figures in campaign ads. Consistent with the "issue ownership" literature in American politics, it could be that Democratic candidates may be more inclined to employ certain types of military imagery, or to feature military figures in overtly partisan ways, on the grounds that doing so may make the Democratic candidate appear to be strong on national security issues. Through the lens of "issue ownership," Republicans have generally been perceived by the public as stronger than Democrats on defense and national security issues, and thus Democrats appear to be more inclined (and Republicans less so) to engage in efforts that shore up their defense credentials [@petrocik_issue_2003; @sides_consequences_2007]. I control for a candidate's veteran status because perhaps civilian candidates who themselves are veterans are more inclined to tout their own security credentials, and to use military figures to do so in ways that violate the principles of civil-military relations.

The most important result in Table \@ref(tab:ch4regression1) is the positive and statistically significant coefficient for percentage of veterans in the population in models 1-5, 7, and 9. This provides moderate evidence consistent with H3, which stated that civilian leaders increasingly violate the central principles of civil-military relations in public and visible ways when military prestige is high relative to low military prestige (H3). 

The positive and statistically significant coefficient for percentage of veterans in the population in models 5, 7, and 9 is of particular importance with respect to adherence to principles of civil-military relations. It denotes that as the percentage of veterans in the population of a geographic area rises, civilian candidates and parties are increasingly likely to air advertisements in that geographic area that feature a military figure making a prominent appearance (model 5), endorsing political candidates (model 7), and addressing topics that are tangential to their military expertise (model 9). 

In terms of substantive importance, the coefficient for percentage of veterans in the population of .021 (model 7) indicates that for every one percent increase in a media market's veteran share of the population, the odds of a political candidate airing an advertisement that features a military figure endorsing a political candidate increase by 2.1 percent. This is not in itself a large increase. However, the difference in values of veterans in the population may in fact vary by several percentage points between media markets. The odds of a party airing an advertisement featuring a military actor endorsing a political candidate is 16.2 percent greater, for instance, in a media market whose veteran density is eight percentage points higher than that of another (for example, in a media market where veterans are 11 percent of the population relative to another where veterans make up only three percent of the population). 

It is also worth pointing out the coefficient for GOP. The negative and statistically significant coefficient in models 5-8 suggests that over the time period examined, Republican Party candidates are less likely than Democratic candidates to air advertisements that feature military actors who appear prominently (model 5), commit any violation (model 6), endorse (model 7), or attack political candidates (model 8). This result is consistent with expectations from the "issue ownership" literature [@petrocik_issue_2003]. 

Furthermore, a candidate's veteran status likewise seems to be important. The coefficient for candidate-veteran is positive and statistically significant in all but one model specification (model 9), indicating that candidates who themselves are veterans are highly more inclined than non-veteran candidates to show military imagery of any type, or to include military actors who appear prominently and engage in overtly partisan behaviors in campaign ads. A candidate's veteran status is in itself _not_ a measure of military prestige per se, but the fact that veteran candidates are willing to showcase themselves as veterans attests to a general sense in which the military has some general sense of prestige during elections. In other words, veteran candidates would likely not tout their laurels as military veterans if in fact their status as veterans did not amount to any advantage, actual or perceived, over their opponents. 

Due to space constraints, it is not necessary nor prudent to address each of the election cycle-campaign season fixed effects shown in Table \@ref(tab:ch4regression1). It is sufficient to point out that some are statistically significant and the same direction across several model specifications, and to state that this is consistent with the broad notion that the timing of an airing of a political advertisement matters. As noted in the presentation of descriptive statistics, there are a host of possible reasons why military imagery and military actors are more likely to appear at certain times than at other times. One such reason that is difficult to analyze is the general arc of American foreign policy and the presence of wars or other crises that are strongly associated with military forces. These seem to take on more prominence during some times rather than at other times.   

The most vital takeaway from Table \@ref(tab:ch4regression1) is that even after controlling for the possibility that every election cycle and the campaign season within each election cycle possesses its own attributes (by including fixed effects) -- and results suggest that they do -- there is a positive and statistically significant coefficient for percentage of veterans in the population in seven of nine models. This strongly suggests that political parties and candidates target veteran-rich geographic areas differently than other areas of the nation. Furthermore, when the measure of percentage of veterans in the population is viewed as a proxy for the measure for military prestige, the results are consistent with the expectation that as military prestige rises, civilian leaders are increasingly inclined to feature military actors in ways that violate the central principles of civil-military relations in specific ways (making endorsements of political candidates and addressing outside issues).

### OLS Regression

In the OLS regression analysis, the dependent variable is the proportion of ads aired in each election cycle-campaign season that feature various types of military imagery, prominent appearances by military actors, and any violation engaged in by these military actors. The unit of analysis here is the election cycle-campaign season-media market (n=1,239). In other words, the unit of analysis is the proportion of ads featuring military imagery, actors, and actor behavior aired in and during, for example, the 2004 primary campaign in the Chicago, IL Media Market, or the 2016 general campaign in the Columbus, OH Media Market.  

Because the unit of analysis has changed, the OLS regression analysis will not support including the variables of party and a candidate's veteran status. The only variable I include, in addition to the election cycle-campaign season fixed effects, is the percentage of veterans in the population of each media market represented in the data. The results are displayed in Table \@ref(tab:ch4regression2).

The most significant difference shown in Table \@ref(tab:ch4regression2) is that the coefficient for percentage of veterans in the population remains positive and statistically significant when the dependent variable denotes the presentation of types of military imagery (models 1-4), but not when the dependent variable denotes a prominent military figure appearance or a military figure engaging in a specific violation of the principles of civil-military relations (models 5-9). 

There are a couple of reasons why the results between the logistic regression and OLS regression analyses may be different. First, in the OLS regression analysis, all election cycle-campaign season media markets -- the unit of analysis -- carry the same statistical weight. This is different from the logistic regression analysis, which, because the unit of analysis is the individual advertisement, accounts for media markets airing more ads altogether than others.^[The story is further complicated, however, because some media markets are located at times in very competitive political districts, whereas others fall in what might be considered safe areas for one particular political party or candidate. This matters because it drives how many airings political parties and candidates decide to run in a particular media market. Controlling for the political competitiveness of a media market, however, is beyond the scope of this chapter, mainly because media markets do not square, geographically, onto clean units of electoral analysis, especially at higher echelons, such as races for US House, Senate, or Governor.]  

A second reason why the OLS analysis may reflect somewhat different results than the logit regression previously displayed is that the OLS analysis does not include a couple of airing-specific variables, such as party and veteran status of the candidate. Because the unit of analysis in the logistic regression is the individual advertisement, these variables were able to be controlled for, whereas the OLS regression simply cannot facilitate the inclusion of these variables.

Though it would be ideal if the logistic and OLS regression results displayed exactly the same results, that they are different should not be viewed as a significant issue. If anything, the logistic regression results presented here should be viewed as the more compelling of the two sets of results presented. There are two reasons for this assertion, each of which corresponds to the reasons just offered to describe why the logistic and OLS regression results may be different. 

First, we know that media markets do in fact generate varying levels of campaign advertisements, as shown in Table \@ref(tab:top-bottom-vet-mkts). Second, each aired advertisement facilitates the observation of ad-level variables that can only be controlled for in the logistic regression. In other words, when an ad is observed, it is automatically possible to ascertain control variables such as the veteran status and the political party of a featured candidate or group of candidate(s). For these reasons, while we certainly should not discount the OLS regression results, we can perhaps pay more attention to the logistic regression results, and to what they point to.

To be clear, the results obtained in this chapter do not enable drawing the firm and sharp conclusion that variation in military prestige -- as measured by the per capita veteran population in each media market -- drives the degree to which political candidates employ military figures in campaign ads in ways that violate the principles of civil-military relations. We cannot draw this conclusion firmly because there may be other factors that are correlated with the per capita veteran population, such as partisanship, that may prove to play a stronger role in influencing the degree to which military figures appear in advertisements, and the subsequent behavior these figures undertake. It could also be that veterans in each media market simply constitute a potential voting block that political candidates are cognizant of and subsequently target through advertising. Through this lens, there is no linkage between military prestige and the per capita veteran population of a media market.

Although this is a very real possibility, we cannot ignore that contemporary scholars have shown evidence that suggests military enlistment is not random to geographic location, even if scholars have not concluded the underlying reasons why this is the case [@savell_numbers_2020]. Therefore, we can conclude that the results presented here are at the very least consistent with the notion that to the degree that per capita veteran population is a plausible proxy for military prestige, variation in military prestige impacts the degree to which military figures appear in presidential campaign ads, endorse political candidates explicitly, and address outside issues. 

Future research should attempt to further explore the potential connection between military prestige -- as viewed as the centrality or importance of the military -- and the per capita veteran population of a geographic locale, including the media market. This could be done by including other controls that vary at the media market (rather than at the state, or at the congressional district) level. As this analysis has demonstrated, county-level data is a solid starting point for future scholars to explore this topic.^[Some examples of this data might include the percentage of county voters registered by party affiliation. Such a measure might serve as a reasonable measure of partisanship.]  

### Similarities and Differences Between Alternate Regression Specifications

In the appendix, I show regression tables (logit and OLS) where election cycle-campaign season fixed effects are removed. These are displayed in Table \@ref(tab:ch4regressionappx1) and Table \@ref(tab:ch4regressionappx2). 

In these alternate regression constructs, which are far less restrictive than those which have been featured here, the results very much reflect those that have been shown here in the main body of the chapter. In particular, the logit regression indicates that an increase in the percentage of veterans in the population strongly increases the likelihood that candidates and/or parties air ads that either feature military imagery, or include military actors who engage in acts that violate civil-military relations. Similar to the OLS regression analysis presented here in the main body of the chapter, the OLS regression analysis displayed in the appendix indicates that an increase in the percentage of veterans is associated with increasing portions of ad airings that show military imagery, but not military actors engaging in acts that violate civil-military relations. 

The main difference between the regression analyses presented here in the main body of the chapter and in the appendix is that the results shown in the appendix indicate that other variables are also statistically significant (and quite often). However, these variables include those that vary precisely by year (level of polarization hostile casualty rate), and which justified the use of campaign season-election cycle fixed effects to begin with. Statistically, this suggests that the use of these fixed effects have served their purpose insofar as facilitating the evaluation of this chapter's main independent variable of interest, military prestige (as measured by per capita veteran population).

### Predicted Probability 

I now transform one of the logistic regression results shown in Table \@ref(tab:ch4regression1) into a predicted probability in order to graphically show the substantive importance of a media market's density of veterans in the population on the probability that a political candidate or party airs an ad featuring a military figure violating civil-military relations. Using the coefficient from model 7 (endorse) in Table \@ref(tab:ch4regression1), Figure \@ref(fig:ch4-pred-prob) shows the probability that a single advertisement aired features a military figure who prominently appears in a campaign ad and endorses a political candidate running for office. The three vertical lines denote the percentage of veterans in the media markets associated with the New York City media market, which comprises portions of New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and New Jersey; the national average; and the most concentrated area in the country for veterans, the Norfolk, VA media market.

Note that there is some baseline level of probability (.0010) that a single ad aired will violate the principle of non-partisanship by featuring a military actor who endorses a candidate running for office. The shape of the fitted line shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ch4-pred-prob) is also generally linear. The most important takeaway from Figure \@ref(fig:ch4-pred-prob) is that the probability of a single ad violating the principle of non-partisanship by featuring a military actor engaging in an act of endorsement rises more as we move farther along the x-axis. 

If we focus solely on the point estimates shown in \@ref(fig:ch4-pred-prob), the resounding message is that the most discernible differences are evident when one moves from examining an area that has a relatively sparse concentration of veterans in the population, such as the New York City media market, to a locale where a greater percentage of veterans constitute the overall population. Based off of point estimates, for example, there is a 24% greater chance that a single advertisement aired in the Norfolk, VA media market features a military figure who endorses another candidate compared to a single advertisement aired in the New York City media market. 

However, this plot also suggests that we exercise some caution in discerning how critical the role that veterans as a portion of the population plays. For instance, note that the very upper end of the confidence interval where the x axis equates to the veteran per capita population of the New York media market crosses the very lower end of the confidence interval where the x axis equates to the veteran per capita population in the Norfolk, VA media market. Given the size of the standard errors that comprise the confidence interval, there may not be any discernible difference at all in veteran rich versus veteran sparse areas, except when the per capita veteran population takes extreme values.  

### Alternate Explanations

In this section of the chapter, I address alternate explanations. Aside from the percentage of veterans living in a particular media market, what other factor(s) account for the variation uncovered in this chapter? Here, we have to think carefully about what else besides the veteran density of the population may be causing cross-sectional variation across media markets with respect to ads that show military imagery, or military actors who appear prominently in ads, and the behaviors these actors commit. We need to also think about what factors might impact where veterans choose to live and that are also correlated with the use of military imagery or military figures in campaign ads.  

Earlier, this chapter noted that veterans might simply return home after their military service. If this is the case, then we also have to think about why certain states, as demonstrated by Savell and McMahon (2020), produce more military recruits per capita than others. Though researchers have not convincingly answered this question, this chapter noted that individual economic prospects, military culture, and partisanship may play a role in driving an individual to join the military. 

Even if there are other reasons that impact where veterans decide to live other than they simply return to their home of origin, the factors listed above may also be correlated with each other and with the use of military imagery and/or military figures in campaign advertisements. This further complicates identification of the real reason(s) behind why certain parts of the country seem to air a greater portion of campaign ads with military imagery and military actors than others. 

Still, we can think through how these alternate explanations might be at work. Suppose, for example, that tax benefits for veterans are enacted predominantly by one political party over another, or in one region of the country over another, we could not conclude that the veteran density level in fact is the underlying factor driving the patterns of variation examined in this chapter. We would instead have to conclude that partisanship is actually driving where veterans reside, and that this in turn shapes the veteran percentage of the population, which drives the types of advertisements candidates and parties decide to air in a certain geographic area. Perhaps there is a simpler link between partisanship and where veterans choose to live. Perhaps veterans simply choose to live in states where one political party tends to hold sway, if for no other reason, than because perhaps veterans tend to identify with one party more so than with the other. 

Examining other factors such as partisanship will require obtaining data and then aggregating this data at the same geographic level of analysis as the data examined in this chapter (media market). This presents some unique challenges, as media markets frequently cross state boundaries (nearly one third of the time). To get around this very real challenge, future research should examine as finely grained political data available, ideally at the country level, before aggregating counties into media markets. This too, however, will introduce its own challenges, since at some level, media markets are units of analysis primarily for political advertising rather than formal politics. 

In spite of these challenges, this analysis has at least made it possible to rule out other alternate explanations. For example, civil-military principles themselves do not vary across the country. The reason that we can be convinced of this is because the military is a national institution. This has been true since at least the end of the Civil War, and has especially been the case during the period examined in this chapter, from 2000-2016. And yet, one of the fundamental empirical contributions of this chapter has been to show that _adherence_ to these central principles, however, _does_ vary within country. While I have argued that one compelling reason this is the case stems from changes in the level of military prestige within country, conclusively addressing this subject requires future research. 

## Conclusion 

### Summary

For methodological reasons, this chapter employed a proxy measure for the variable of military prestige consisting of the percentage of veterans in the population of the 211 distinct media markets represented across the data. The argument presented in support of the use of this proxy measure is not that it is a perfect measure of military prestige, but that it is a plausible alternate measure of military prestige. 

Furthermore, the empirical results featured in this chapter have shown mild evidence for H3, which stated that civilian actors are increasingly likely to employ the military in ways that violate the principles of civil-military relations when military prestige is high relative to when military prestige is low. To be more accurate in this chapter specifically, we might amend this hypothesis to state that civilian actors are increasingly likely to employ the military in ways that violate the principles of civil-military relations _where_ military prestige is high relative to _where_ military prestige is low. 

The strongest evidence in support of this claim was found through the logistic regression analysis, the results of which are displayed in Table \@ref(tab:ch4regression1). The logistic regression results in this chapter included election cycle-campaign season fixed effects, essentially controlling for any other omitted variables. The OLS regression results did not reflect the same consistency as the logit regression results, but these should not be viewed as contradicting each other. Instead, the logit regression analysis should be seen as accommodating more control variables and adjusting to the fact that not all media markets are equal in terms of the volume of political ads aired. 

The main shortcoming of this chapter is the fact that media markets almost certainly vary in more ways than just the percentage of veterans who reside there. Polarization, partisanship, and patriotism (loosely defined) are all axes along which this may be true. Future research should incorporate these possibilities and determine the degree to which veteran density remains a compelling factor that drives the content of political advertising in certain areas of the country. This will likely require compiling data at the county level, and then aggregating these into media markets, as this chapter has.   

The results shown in this chapter are nonetheless important. Similar to the previous chapter, this one has uncovered a connection between one type of civil-military actor, a particular behavior that violates the principles of civil-military relations, and a compelling reason why variation in this behavior may occur. The previous chapter established that _military_ actors increasingly write opinion editorials that violate the principles of civil-military relations due to rising levels of polarization; this chapter found support consistent with the expectation that civilian actors air political advertisements that increasingly violate the principles of civil-military relations as the level of military prestige (as measured by the proxy of veteran density in the population) rises.   

In the next chapter, the first of the two case studies switches gears. Instead of focusing on one type of actor and one type of behavior, the focus in each of the next two chapters includes the tenor, tone, and characteristics of the many political behaviors that occur in a particular era. Using process tracing, the goal of each of the next two chapters is to show that changes in predominantly one of the independent variables resulted in discernible variation in the tenor, tone, and characteristics of political behaviors undertaken by civilian and military actors. 

While large-N statistical analyses (of the type undertaken in Chapters 3 and 4 of this dissertation) and qualitative case studies may in fact, as Gerring (2011) describes, "explore the world in different ways," the two methods should not be viewed as "rival genres," but rather as complimentary methods that ultimately help "synthesize" each other [@gerring_case_2011]. With this in mind, we now turn to the first case study, an examination of political behaviors involving the military during the fifteen years after the American Civil War.
